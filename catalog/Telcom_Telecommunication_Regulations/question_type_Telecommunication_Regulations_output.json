                        "Various international organizations promote the development and harmonization of telecommunications services in different regions of the world through various means, such as providing financial assistance, technical assistance, promoting co-operation and co-ordination among regulatory agencies, and publishing data and studies. For example, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) provides financial assistance for the establishment, expansion, improvement, and integration of public telecommunications systems, while the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) promotes harmonization and standardization processes. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) provides technical assistance at all stages of the projects it finances and supports its member countries in the rationalization of telecommunications activities, with special emphasis on institutional reform and strengthening of regulatory capabilities. The Inter-American Telecommunications Commission (CITEL) facilitates and promotes the development of telecommunications in the Americas to contribute to the overall development of the region. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publishes data and studies on telecommunications markets and promotes telecommunications reform as a means to achieve sustainable growth and employment that contributes to economic and social welfare, as well as to the expansion of world trade. Additionally, the Latin American Forum of Telecommunications Regulators (REGULATEL) encourages co-operation and co-ordination of efforts among 16 Latin American telecommunications regulatory agencies and promotes the development of telecommunications in the region."

                        "The WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications (ABT) incorporates many of the reforms provided in the Reference Paper in Appendix A, which has become a benchmark for telecommunications sector reforms worldwide. The ABT aims to promote competition, increase efficiency, and improve access to telecommunications services. The Reference Paper, on the other hand, provides a framework for regulatory reforms that support the implementation of the ABT. In developing countries, the implementation of these reforms can be challenging due to limited resources and infrastructure. However, the Reference Paper offers guidance on how to establish transparent regulatory processes, promote competition, and attract investment in the telecommunications sector, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the ABT's objectives."
