This is particularly important in Singapore's healthcare system, where individuals are encouraged to take personal responsibility for their healthcare expenses through the '3M' system. By ensuring the financial stability of insurance companies, the MAS helps to ensure that individuals have access to affordable health insurance options, which in turn allows them to make informed choices about their healthcare and take preventive measures to maintain their health. Additionally, the MAS's regulation of the insurance sector helps to keep healthcare costs down by promoting competition among insurance companies, which incentivizes them to offer lower premiums and better coverage. This helps to alleviate some of the financial burden on the government, which can then focus on providing subsidies and support for public healthcare institutions. Overall, the MAS's role in regulating the financial aspect of the insurance sector is crucial in ensuring the sustainability and affordability of healthcare services in Singapore."
