Firstly, the scale-back of pandemic-related contract jobs led to a more pronounced decline in the incidence of fixed-term contract employees in sectors that had earlier seen larger increases, such as Public Administration & Defence, Accommodation, Health & Social Services, and Real Estate Services. Secondly, the tight labour market in 2022 contributed to a decline in the incidence of fixed-term contract employees in growth sectors like Professional Services, Financial & Insurance Services, and Information & Communications. This decline was also driven by improvements in the educational profile of the workforce, which led to a higher share of professionals, managers, executives & technicians (PMETs) among employed residents. As a result, the proportion of fixed-term contract employees declined across most age, sex, and education groups. This shift towards more permanent employment arrangements had an impact on the overall employment landscape, as it reflected a more stable and secure job market. The tight labour market also contributed to a robust increase in median income for young resident tertiary graduates in employment, particularly for those in permanent jobs. Overall, the decline in fixed-term contract employees and the shift towards permanent employment arrangements suggest a strengthening of the job market in Singapore in 2022."

The relaxation of pandemic-related restrictions and the re-opening of borders led to more part-time workers in consumer-facing and tourism-related sectors such as Food & Beverage Services, Retail Trade, Accommodation, and Arts, Entertainment & Recreation being able to work the number of hours they desired, resulting in a decline in time-related underemployment rate from 3.5% in 2021 to 3.0% in 2022, with notable improvements among those who were more adversely affected by the pandemic, such as those in their 50s and older, those with non-tertiary qualifications, as well as among service & sales workers and cleaners, labourers & related workers. The fall in self-employment largely came from own account workers, whose share of the resident workforce edged down for the second consecutive year following the high in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a decrease led by workers aged 60 & over."

Firstly, the tight labour market led to a shift towards permanent employment, as seen in the increase in the proportion of permanent employees to 86% for degree holders from local autonomous universities. Additionally, the scale-back of pandemic-related contract jobs in sectors such as Public Administration & Defence, Accommodation, Health & Social Services, and Real Estate Services also contributed to the decline. Furthermore, the ongoing upward trajectory of the PMET share in the resident workforce, supported by robust manpower demand in outward-oriented sectors, also played a role in the decline of fixed-term contract employees in growth sectors."

However, mature workers have continued to prioritize training to remain relevant in the dynamic employment landscape. This suggests that there is a growing recognition of the importance of lifelong learning and upskilling, especially among older workers who may be looking to switch careers or adapt to changing job demands. Additionally, the fact that training participation rates have remained steady among the unemployed suggests that jobseekers recognize the value of training in enhancing their employability in a competitive job market. Overall, the shifts in training participation rates reflect a changing attitude towards lifelong learning and employability in Singapore, where workers are proactively investing in their skills and knowledge to stay relevant and competitive in the post-pandemic era."
