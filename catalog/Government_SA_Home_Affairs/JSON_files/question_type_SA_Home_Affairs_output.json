This aligns with the department's mandate to regulate the secure movement of people through ports of entry into and out of South Africa, as well as its objective to ensure that 95% of critical skills visa applications are adjudicated within 4 weeks. The e-Visa system also supports the department's efforts to modernize and coordinate border management, as outlined in the Border Management Act, 2020, by providing an integrated and automated platform for processing visa applications. This helps to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the department's services, while also supporting the government's aim to promote tourism and economic growth."

In light of the Constitutional Court's judgement in the New Nation Movement NPC and Others v the President of South Africa matter, the minimalist model addresses the defects of the Electoral Act 73 of 1998 by allowing adult citizens to be elected to the National Assembly (NA) and Provincial Legislatures (PLs) through means other than their membership in political parties. This model does not interfere with the constitutionally required general proportionality and can be achieved without significant changes to the existing legislation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the minimalist model aligns with the principles of equality, non-discrimination, and human dignity as encapsulated in the Constitution of RSA, which is also reflected in the White Paper on Marriages and the Official Identity Management (OIM) Policy. Moreover, the minimalist model's emphasis on proportional representation can contribute to the development of a new single legislation that will regulate all marriages in SA, as it ensures that diverse voices and perspectives are represented in the legislative process. The implications of the minimalist model on the development of a new single legislation on marriages in SA may include the inclusion of provisions that protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, religious, or cultural persuasions, and the establishment of a fair and transparent system for the appointment of marriage officers."
