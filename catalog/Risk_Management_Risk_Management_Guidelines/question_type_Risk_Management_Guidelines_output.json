The CFP also supports the RMGs' goal of ensuring safe and sound operations by providing a buffer to absorb unexpected losses, thereby minimizing the potential impact of unforeseen events on institutions. Additionally, the CFP's focus on identifying, measuring, and monitoring strategic risks is consistent with the RMGs' emphasis on risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems. By adhering to the CFP, institutions can effectively manage their risks and meet the requirements of the RMGs, ultimately achieving safe and sound operations and optimal risk-return trade-offs."
