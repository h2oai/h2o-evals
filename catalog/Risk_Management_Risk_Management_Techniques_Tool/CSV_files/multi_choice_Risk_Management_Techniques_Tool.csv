"31 ANNEXES ANNEXES ANNEX 1: RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS There are many different tools and techniques to  assist the various steps of the risk assessment  process. More detailed information on these tools  can be found in ISO Standard 31010:2009 “Risk management – Risk assessment techniques”.  Risk identification Techniques The above-mentioned ISO Standard 31010:2009 lists the following techniques that can be used in the identification of risks 17:  • Brainstorming; • The Delphi technique; • Structured or semi-structured interviews; • Use of check-lists; • Primary hazard analysis; • Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP); • Hazard Analysis and Critical Control (HACCP); • Environmental risk assessment; • Scenario analysis;• Structure “What if?” (SWIFT); • Failure mode effect analysis; • Cause-and-effect analysis; • Human reliability analysis; • Reliability centred maintenance; • Consequence/probability matrix; and • Fault tree analysis. Instead of using only one technique, a combina- tion of different tools should be used where appro- priate. It is also important to combine aspects of  qualitative and quantitative analysis in order to  reach the best outcomes.  Tools As previously shown, a risk register is an essen- tial documentation tool for risk management. The  risk register is like an “index” of an administra-tion’s risks, from which each functional area can  develop its respective risk plans. The register should be tailored to meet the requirements  of the organization and may be set out in many  different ways. Three examples of risk registers  appear below.

ISO Standard 31010:2009 “Risk management – Risk assessment techniques” includes additional details on the above-mentioned techniques. 32 ANNEXESRisk analysis Techniques Various techniques and tools for the risk anal- ysis process are recognized by ISO Standard  31010:2009 “Risk management – Risk assessment        techniques”.

Used strategi-cally, compliance measurement and targeting  can provide the necessary balance to help  focus resources effectively in areas of concern to Customs. In addition, the results of initial compliance measurements can provide impor- tant information to enhance risk assessment  methodologies. A compliance management programme also  provides a basis for Customs to assess its own performance in revenue protection and enforce- ment of laws, improve its efficiency and effec- tiveness, and develop strategies to improve compliance. Compliance Measurement Areas One approach to compliance measurement is to consider that in some countries or economic unions, as few as 10% of traders account for over 80% of imports and exports. By focusing  on the top 5-10% of these highest volume  manufacturers, importers, exporters and commodities, Customs can ensure that those which have the most significant impact on the national economy are being reviewed more   effectively.Compliance measurement areas may include: Documentary issues:• proper tariff classification by traders; • proper valuation by traders; and • country of origin. Procedural issues: • importation and exportation (from the goods  declaration through revenue collection); • transit operations; and • warehousing, free trade zones, processing. Revenue issues: • timely and accurate revenue payments; and • proper posting of securities. Transport issues: • accurate reporting of the quantity of goods; • accurate description of goods on the manifest  and/or transport document; • accuracy of container quantities and identifica-tion numbers; and • transporter compliance. Specific concerns: • compliance by tariff number or range of tariff  numbers; • public health and safety issues; • Intellectual property rights and copyright issues; • compliance with trade agreements; • proper country of origin marking on goods; • high revenue commodities; and • selected traders. Measurement Process Customs gathers data from a variety of sources,  both internal and external, and by both manual  and automated means. With the data (import and export records), the tools (statistical anal- ysis) and the methodology (systematic analysis 39 ANNEXES of large traders or commodities), Customs can  arrive at reasonable, informed conclusions about the compliance rates of many entities. These  rates can be determined for each step of a trans- action process, e.g. for imports, from the mani- fest to the goods declaration to the collection  of duty and taxes. The automated systems that  Customs uses to evaluate high-risk shipments  can support the compliance review require-ments for a scientific approach to accurate data  collection and analysis and projections, although  compliance rates can also be measured effec- tively without automation. Customs should determine a designated universe  of transactions and, using a statistically valid  sampling methodology, select specific transac- tions or entities from this universe for review  or verification. Depending upon the results, the  universe may be modified in many ways.  Customs must also determine what level of  compliance is acceptable. For example, a compli- ance rate of 95% of the transactions or entities  reviewed in a given area may be the acceptable level for an administration. This may also be  called the level of tolerance. Some of the transaction processes for compliance  verifications would be : • goods declaration compliance; • trader compliance; • transit compliance; • free trade zone or warehouse compliance; • manifest and transport document compliance ; and • transporter compliance. Below are a few factors that should be considered  during a verification review for a selected example  of these processes",What is the purpose of compliance measurement for Customs administrations?,"[""To assess the effectiveness of Customs' enforcement strategies."", 'To identify areas of non-compliance and improve revenue collection.', 'To evaluate the performance of Customs officials.', ""To monitor traders' compliance with trade agreements.""]",1,Risk_Management_Techniques_Tool.pdf

Compliance Measurement Areas One approach to compliance measurement is to consider that in some countries or economic unions, as few as 10% of traders account for over 80% of imports and exports. By focusing  on the top 5-10% of these highest volume  manufacturers, importers, exporters and commodities, Customs can ensure that those which have the most significant impact on the national economy are being reviewed more   effectively.Compliance measurement areas may include: Documentary issues:• proper tariff classification by traders; • proper valuation by traders; and • country of origin. Procedural issues: • importation and exportation (from the goods  declaration through revenue collection); • transit operations; and • warehousing, free trade zones, processing. Revenue issues: • timely and accurate revenue payments; and • proper posting of securities. Transport issues: • accurate reporting of the quantity of goods; • accurate description of goods on the manifest  and/or transport document; • accuracy of container quantities and identifica-tion numbers; and • transporter compliance. Specific concerns: • compliance by tariff number or range of tariff  numbers; • public health and safety issues; • Intellectual property rights and copyright issues; • compliance with trade agreements; • proper country of origin marking on goods; • high revenue commodities; and • selected traders. Measurement Process Customs gathers data from a variety of sources,  both internal and external, and by both manual  and automated means. With the data (import and export records), the tools (statistical anal- ysis) and the methodology (systematic analysis 39 ANNEXES of large traders or commodities), Customs can  arrive at reasonable, informed conclusions about the compliance rates of many entities. These  rates can be determined for each step of a trans- action process, e.g. for imports, from the mani- fest to the goods declaration to the collection  of duty and taxes.

"This may also be  called the level of tolerance. Some of the transaction processes for compliance  verifications would be : • goods declaration compliance; • trader compliance; • transit compliance; • free trade zone or warehouse compliance; • manifest and transport document compliance ; and • transporter compliance. Below are a few factors that should be considered  during a verification review for a selected example  of these processes. Goods Declaration Compliance a) Is there evidence of documentation to support  an accurate goods declaration? b) Do the quantities declared match what is  contained in the consignment? c) Does the declared country of origin match the  country of origin marking on the goods?d) Does the declared description of the goods  match the actual goods? Thus, a typical compliance measurement review  relating to intellectual property rights for a selected commodity, at a tolerance level of 95%, might progress as follows : a) Conduct a statistically valid random sampling  of goods declarations for the selected HS  number. b) If the resulting compliance rate is less than  95%, conduct another measurement of the  same HS number, but stratified by selected countries of origin. c) For countries of origin found to have a compli- ance rate of less than 95%, conduct a meas- urement for each of the major importers. d) For importers found to have a compliance rate  of less than 95%, Customs should seek to: • inform the importer (“informed compliance”); • establish profiles/targets for the identified  areas of non-compliance; • conduct subsequent measurements to ensure that the importer has corrected the problem; • conduct more reviews and/or examinations; and • issue fines or penalties, if appropriate, in cases of continued non-compliance. Use of Compliance Measurement Results  within the Control Programme Statistically valid compliance measurement  procedures can be used in various ways, e.g. to: • define any revenue gap; • prevent widespread commercial fraud; • assess performance by major key industries; • assess performance by major importers and  exporters; • increase commercial compliance; and • accurately measure international trade.

By charting the current position of your economy, the matrix will assist in helping to identify the next steps to refining or building your risk management process. The subject areas of Purpose/Context/Scope, Risk Management Concept, Data, Analysis, and Employee Investment are individually assessed based on the following stages: Starting Point, Awareness, Realization, Focus, Adaptation and Integration. Your economy will investigate the subject areas and after gath-ering data, will determine at what stage in that subject area you are. While dependent on each other in practice, the subject areas should be assessed independently and not against each other. It is therefore realistic to be in a Focus stage in reference to your Data subject area, and be at the Starting Point in your Employee Investment subject area. There is no right or wrong answer to this assessment. The purpose is to help your economy see where it currently is, and assist you in advancing your current position. To properly use this tool, look at the definition in  the Starting Point stage for the first subject area Purpose/Context/Scope, and assess whether you have reached this point based on the defi-nition. If you have, then review the definition in  the Awareness Stage. If you have reached this  stage, look at the definition in the Realization stage and assess your organization. If you have  reached this stage, then review the definition against your current position in the Focus stage. Continue reviewing the definitions in relation to the current status of your organization until you reach the Integration stage. If at any point before reaching the Integration stage, you find the defi-nition that best describes your organization, you  have determined your current position.

In some countries, this function has taken the form of a national risk assessment/targeting centre.  There are different organizational models for  operating a risk assessment/targeting centre. Models depend on organizational roles, struc-tures, activities and functions. They may be centralized, decentralized or a mixture of the two. Often this is also influenced by the ICT capabili- ties of the organization. There is no “one size fits  all” organizational model for establishing such a  centre. The following activities seem to be typical  of the centres currently in existence: • manage selectivity and targeting criteria; • manage risk analysis related IT systems and  assist with their development; • provide 24/7/365 tactical analysis and coordi-nation capacity to front-line operations; • assist with planning & resource deployment; • act as a hub for risk related information exchange; and • provide a platform for stakeholder and Coordi-nated Border Management (CBM) cooperation. Selectivity and targeting Risk assessment and targeting centres carry out analytical functions and develop selectivity and targeting criteria relating to activities such as vetting commercial transactions, revenue assur-ance, fraud and other illegal activities, profiling  of travellers, enforcing prohibitions and restric- tions, and cultural heritage protection. In some  cases these centres serve as a nexus for gathering  information from a wide variety of sources (public domain and law enforcement), both internal and external to Customs. Most often they use auto-mated analysis and trade-based research tools (importation trends, common traits, profiles, past violations, passenger data, etc.) to conduct these activities in conjunction with existing Intelligence products. The outcome of the analysis leads to  the development of risk profiles and examina- tion criteria, enabling Customs to identify those  transactions most likely to be non-compliant in  a dynamic manner, thus enabling more effective  resource planning and deployment responses to  situations presenting the highest risks.  The centres contribute to the management of  the selectivity system and can enter criteria into electronic and/or manual systems.

While most often managed centrally, this function will gener-ally include selectivity and targeting criteria  derived from national systems and regional or  local experience. This ensures that national risk management goals and objectives are met and that local knowledge and experience enrich the process. The centres analyze the resultant “hits”, collect, and store information from front-line interventions, which in turn enables the contin-uous refinement and development of the selec-tion and targeting criteria in conjunction with intelligence units.  Information systems and their development As mentioned above, risk assessment and targeting centres often have a role in managing electronic risk analysis systems and inserting the risk rules, profiles and statistically valid random selection criteria. Their tasks can also include keeping the system and its content relevant.  Operational support Centres tend to operate on a 24/7/365 basis and support front-line operational activity by providing additional tactical analysis capacity. They bring added value to the front line by providing analysis capacity to operational inquiries originating in realtime from business operations such as goods  inspection, passenger inspection, transport and  vessel search and investigations activities. The  centres can also provide support to resource plan- ning and deployment, particularly in dynamic situ-ations where mobile units may be dispatched to address risks or to bolster static resources where they are deemed insufficient to deal with a high-risk situation. 47 ANNEXES Information coordination and exchange hubs Risk assessment and targeting centres often facil- itate information exchange on risk related issues, both nationally and internationally.

The KCS has traditionally conducted risk analysis for post- audit on illegal transactions and tax  evasion cases, and also established a Customs  Data Warehouse (CDW) in 2002.The CDW collected data not just from Customs  divisions but from other government agencies such as the Ministry of Justice, National Tax Service, Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade, and  Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs",What is the future plan for the Jamaica Customs Department's risk management approach?,"['Implement client education', 'Introduce legislative amendments', 'Increase the number of officials', 'Focus on low-risk areas']",1,Risk_Management_Techniques_Tool.pdf

United States “Risk-based, layered approach to supply chain security” The United States Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) has adopted a risk-based layered approach to supply chain security. The methodology has evolved over several years into a comprehensive  strategy that enhances security across all poten-tial transit vectors that is more efficient and cost  effective than alternative approaches that focus  exclusively on a single layer of defense. CBP  is working to detect, prevent or deter attacks  against, or the exploitation of, the supply chain  by utilizing technologies where appropriate, but  is also relying on layers of non sensor based  programmes across air, land and maritime path- ways. Some of these additional layers include: • advanced electronic information under the  24-hour rule – enhanced by the 10+2 importer security filing requirements; • screening all shipment information by inter- facing with import and enforcement systems  using the automated targeting system (ATS)  and national targeting center; • authorized economic operator partnerships with industry and the private sector, such as  C-TPAT; • partnerships with foreign governments such as the container security initiative and secure  freight initiative; • partnerships with other U.S. government agencies such as the Transportation Security  Administration on air cargo security; and • use of non-intrusive inspection technology and  mandatory exams for all high-risk shipments. The objective of this layered approach is to integrate these measures into intersecting  processes, thereby allowing CBP to receive,  process and act upon commercial and security  information in a timely manner. This disciplined  and highly systemized approach enables the  accurate targeting of suspect shipments without  hindering the movement of commerce upon  arrival in US ports.

Some of these additional layers include: • advanced electronic information under the  24-hour rule – enhanced by the 10+2 importer security filing requirements; • screening all shipment information by inter- facing with import and enforcement systems  using the automated targeting system (ATS)  and national targeting center; • authorized economic operator partnerships with industry and the private sector, such as  C-TPAT; • partnerships with foreign governments such as the container security initiative and secure  freight initiative; • partnerships with other U.S. government agencies such as the Transportation Security  Administration on air cargo security; and • use of non-intrusive inspection technology and  mandatory exams for all high-risk shipments. The objective of this layered approach is to integrate these measures into intersecting  processes, thereby allowing CBP to receive,  process and act upon commercial and security  information in a timely manner.
