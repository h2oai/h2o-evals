The Company's financial position and performance are essential in assessing its ability to meet its obligations under the Debenture Stock. The investor should also consider the risks associated with investing in debt securities, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and real estate and property market risk, which are discussed in Section 6 of the PDS.
