"i   Executive Summ ary   The National eHealth Guidelines & Standards were f irst published in 2016  with the aim of streamlin ing  the implementation of eHealth solutions in the health sector of Sri Lanka . These Guidelines and Standards  were intended to be adopted when implementing eHealth solutions in the state and private healthcare  institutions in the country .   The new developments in the digital health ecosystem in the country and innovations in the IC T sector   demanded  reviewing the  existing National eHealth Guidelines & Standards (NeGS) . Recogni zing this need  the National eHealth Steering Committee appointed a Technical Working Group  (Technical Working  Group: Digital Health Standards & Interoperability  (TWG – DHSI) ) to review the NeGS  and recommend  necessary changes. Meanwhile recognizing the importance of digit al health in strengthening primary  health care services, the Primary Healthcare Services Streng thening Project (PSSP) ; included  updat ing the  e-health guidelines and standards  as one of the Disbursement Linked Results (DLR 5.1 S tandards to  support the robust development  of HMIS platforms and use of electronic HMIS at public health service  providers, including with unique individual patient r ecords ).  Based on the recommendation of the above TWG, current developments in the field were incorporated  in the NeGS and changed its name as ‘National Digital Health Guidelines and Standards (NDHGS)’ while  maintaining the major themes and the structure a s of the first version. Following are the main changes  that were made in this version of the NDHGS document:   1. A new chapter included ;  a. Chapter 3 - Digital health software services   2. New sections and subsections added to the existing chapters   a. Sec. 3.2. Electro nic Medical Record Systems   b. Sec. 3.3. National Electronic Health Record   c. Sec. 3.4.

Changes were also made to the content of other chapters to improve the  relevance  and accuracy   of the guidelines and the standards, and to address the current needs .   The document lays down standards and guidelines in the following  seven areas which are imp ortant in   adopti ng ICT in the healthcare sector:        ii   1. Digital Health Architecture – This gives a holistic view of digital h ealth architecture in accordance  with the National ICT Architecture and Infrastructure.       2. Hardware for Digital Health  – This chapter p rescribes guidelines on the management of hardware  for digital health services.       3. Digital Health Software Services – The chapter is on the m anagement of digital health software,  Electronic Medical Record Systems, National Electronic Health Re cord, and Personal Health  Records .    4. Network and Connectivity – This emphasize s the importance of having a proper network plan for  individual healthcare in stitutions and maintaining them.      5. Communication Interface – The importance of having proper website standards, domain name  structure, and official email nomenclature is mentioned in this section. This also emphasizes the  proper use of emails as this coul d be used as an official mode of communication.      6. Privacy, Confidentiality, Security and Medical Ethics – Unlike in many other sectors , the practice  of proper ethical standards and patient privacy bears the highest importance in the field of  healthcare. Th e importance of ensuring privacy, confidentiality , and information security during  the adoption of ICT in the health sector is mentioned  in this section.       7.

However, with the country becoming more prosperous and health services  reaching more citizens, people live longer lives with changes in the ir lifestyles. This has accelerated the  demographic as well as the epidemiological transition leading to an increase in prevalence and the  burden of Non -communicable diseases as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the country.  Meanwhile, the coun try continues to face the burden of some communicable diseases such as Dengue,  Tuberculosis, and influenza.   Fifty percent of outpatient treatment, 95% of hospitalizations, and 99% of the preventive care needs  of the country are provided by the state healt h sector. Therefore, improving the efficiency,  effectiveness, and quality of the state healthcare system would benefit most Sri Lankans. Digital Health  can play a significant role in improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of state as well as  private sector health systems. Identifying the important role of digital health, the Ministry of Health  has published the National eHealth Guidelines and Standards for Sri Lanka in 2016, to achieve  uniformity in the eHealth solutions implemented in Sri Lan ka while ensuring quality care and rights of  the health care recipients.   Further, recent developments and innovations in ICT technologies highlighted the need for revising the  currently published National eHealth Guidelines and Standards. Identifying all these requirements, the  National eHealth Steering Committee has appointed the Technical Working Group: Digital Health  Standards & Interoperability (TWG – DHSI)",What is the name of the document that contains the guidelines and standards for digital health in Sri Lanka?,"['National eHealth Guidelines and Standards for Sri Lanka', 'Digital Health Standards & Interoperability for Sri Lanka', 'Sri Lanka National Healthcare Guidelines and Standards', 'Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Sri Lanka']",0,Digital_Health_Guidelines.pdf

For the transfer and storage of images between software programs in the  medical domain ,  it is recommended that Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine  (DICOM)  version 3   (current version – 3.1) standard of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, USA .  Vendor  Neutral Archiving (VNA) should be used .   (https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/ )     7.6. Standardized Clinical Vocabulary      7.6.1.  For the purpose of coding clinical concepts  in clinical settings other than in the out -patient  depart ment , it is recommended to use or have provisions to use  the Systematized  Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) of the SNOMED International .     7.6.2.  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10th edition of the World Health Organization   (WHO), shall be used to record the final or an intermediate diagnosis of all clinical  encounters that occur in in -patient (inward/ indoor) .      7.6.3.  For the purpose of recording reasons for encounter in the outpatient department (OPD),  primary care, and general practice (GP) settings, it is recommended to use International  Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC -2) ICPC -2.     7.6.4.  It is recommended that  the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Code (ATC) of WHO is used to  code drugs prescribed and dispensed through digital health systems.                26   7.7. Minimal Dataset for the Nationa l Electronic Health Record (NEHR)     7.7.1.  Each EMR System shall submit relevant data elements of following minimal dataset to the  NEHR for each healthcare encounter between a healthcare recipient and a healthcare  provider  where an EMR system  is used to record the encounter output :    A Health Care E ncounter represents a healthcare recipient care event, which involves a Health  Care Provider. The Health Care Encounter is the construct through which all recorded client care  activities are identified. Encounters occur to address Health Concerns, and may also address  known Health Conditions as well. Health Care Encounter Output represents the results of the  event. Currently, NEHR will capture only outputs that are provided by Health Care Providers, such  as a diagnosis that identifies a Health Condition, a clinical procedure, a service being provided, or  a requisition for a diagnostic procedure, medication, referral, medical device , or health care  services. An encounter may occur at a geographic or virtual address and it may also be temporary  clinic/service area (e.g. outreach clinic) , mobile location (e.g., ambulance, mobile lab), or in the  field (e.g.  disaster location , accident site).     The f ollowing  dataset of healthcare recipients’ demographic data  shall be transmitted to the  NEHR  when he/she is registere d with the healthcare system as a new healthcare recipient or when  any of the data elements of the demographic dataset is updated.
