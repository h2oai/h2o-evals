Rul. 78-395, the court and the IRS ruled that a disqualified person's transfer of a promissory note secured by an all-inclusive trust deed on property subject to senior notes to a private foundation was an act of self-dealing, as the statutory language 'subject to a mortgage or similar lien' should be broadly construed to apply to transfers in which an individual may improperly benefit from a transaction even though there's no clear and immediate detriment to or relinquishment by the foundation. Therefore, in cases where a disqualified person transfers a promissory note secured by a deed of trust or similar lien on property subject to senior notes to a private foundation, the exception in Section 4941(d)(2)(F) would not apply, and the transfer would be considered an act of self-dealing."

According to Section 6214(c), the Tax Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the taxable event has been corrected while ruling on a second tier tax deficiency. Moreover, Section 4961(b) gives the Tax Court jurisdiction to conduct a supplemental proceeding to determine whether the taxable event was timely corrected, if the taxpayer seeks one within 90 days after the end of the correction period. Therefore, a taxpayer seeking a supplemental proceeding within 90 days after the end of the correction period can rely on the definition of correction period in Section 4963(e) to determine whether the taxable event has been corrected, and the Tax Court will have jurisdiction to make this determination. If the taxpayer fails to seek a supplemental proceeding within 90 days after the end of the correction period, the IRS may assess a second tier tax deficiency, and the taxpayer will have to pay the deficiency or file a refund suit within the applicable statute of limitations."
