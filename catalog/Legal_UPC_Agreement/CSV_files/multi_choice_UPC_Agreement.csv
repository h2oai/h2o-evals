Without prejudice to paragraph 7 of this Article, actions  referred to in Article 32(1)(a), (c), (f) and (g) shall be brought  before:   (a) the local division hosted by the Contracting Member State  where the actual or threatened infringement has occurred or  may occur, or the regional division in which that  Contracting Member State participates; or   (b) the local division hosted by the Contracting Member State  where the defendant or, in the case of multiple defendants,  one of the defendants has its residence, or principal place of  business, or in the absence of residence or principal place of  business, its place of business, or the regional division in  which that Contracting Member State participates. An action  may be brought against multiple defendants only where the  defendants have a commercial relationship and where the  action relates to the same alleged infringement.  Actions referred to in Article 32(1)(h) shall be brought before  the local or regional division in accordance with point (b) of the  first subparagraph.   Actions against defendants having their residence, or principal  place of business or, in the absence of residence or principal  place of business, their place of business, outside the territory of  the Contracting Member States shall be brought before the local  or regional division in accordance with point (a) of the first  subparagraph or before the central division.   If the Contracting Member State concerned does not host a  local division and does not participate in a regional division,  actions shall be brought before the central division.   2. If an action referred to in Article 32(1)(a), (c), (f), (g) or (h)  is pending before a division of the Court of First Instance, any  action referred to in Article 32(1)(a), (c), (f), (g) or (h) between  the same parties on the same patent may not be brought before  any other division.   If an action referred to in Article 32(1)(a) is pending before a  regional division and the infringement has occurred in the terri ­ tories of three or more regional divisions, the regional division  concerned shall, at the request of the defendant, refer the case  to the central division.   In case an action between the same parties on the same patent  is brought before several different divisions, the division first  seized shall be competent for the whole case and any division  seized later shall declare the action inadmissible in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure.   3. A counterclaim for revocation as referred to in  Article 32(1)(e) may be brought in the case of an action for  infringement as referred to in Article 32(1)(a). The local or  regional division concerned shall, after having heard the  parties, have the discretion either to:   (a) proceed with both the action for infringement and with the  counterclaim for revocation and request the President of the  Court of First Instance to allocate from the Pool of Judges in  accordance with Article 18(3) a technically qualified judge  with qualifications and experience in the field of technology  concerned.   (b) refer the counterclaim for revocation for decision to the  central division and suspend or proceed with the action  for infringement; or   (c) with the agreement of the parties, refer the case for decision  to the central division.EN C 175/10 Official Journal of the European Union 20.6.20134.
