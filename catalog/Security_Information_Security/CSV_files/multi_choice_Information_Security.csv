The “digital economy”, also known as the “knowledge economy”, “networked  economy” or “new economy”, is characterized by a shift from the production of goods to the  creation of ideas. This underscores  the growing,  if not already  central,  role being  played  by  information  and communication technologies (ICTs) in the economy , in particular, and in  society as a  whole.     As a consequence,  governments  worldwide  have  increasingly  focused  on ICTs  for  development  (ICTD). For these governments, ICTD is not only about developing the ICT  industry or sector of the economy, but also encompasses the use of ICTs to stimulate  economic growth, as well as social and political development.     However, among the difficulties that governments face in formulating ICT polic y is  unfamiliarity with a rapidly changing technology landscape and the competencies needed to  harness ICTs for national development. Since one cannot regulate what one does not  understand, many policymakers have shied  away  from ICT policymaking.  But leaving  ICT  policy  to technologists  is also wrong  because  often, technologists  are unaware  of the social   and policy  implications  of the technologies  they are developing and  using.     The Academy of ICT Essentials for Government Leaders module series has been developed  by the Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information and Communication Technology for  Development (APCICT) for:     1. Policymakers  at the national  and local government  level who are responsible  for ICT  policymaking;   2. Government officials responsible for the development and implementation of ICT -based  applications;  and  3. Managers in the public sector seeking to employ ICT tools for project  management.     The module series aims to develop familiarity with the s ubstantive issues related to ICTD  from both a policy and technology perspective. The intention is not to develop a technical  ICT manual. Rather, its purpose is to provide a good understanding of what the current  digital technology is capable of achieving  and where  technology  is headed,  and what  this  implies  for policymaking.

Need for Information Security     Human life today is highly dependent on information and communication s technology (ICT).  This makes individuals, organizations and nations highly vulnerable to attacks on  information systems, such as cyber -intrusions, cyber -terrorism, cyber -crime, and the like.   Few individuals and organizations are equipped to cope with such attacks. Governments  have an important role to play in ensuring information security by expanding the information -  communication infrastructure and establishing systems to protect against informa tion  security threats.     This module focuses on Information Security which is part of Cyber Security.   Issues on  freedom of expression online, human rights online, violence against women and girls  (VAWG) online, digital abuse and online sexual harassment, h ate speech online,  cyberbullying, and child online protection (COP) initiatives have been excluded in this  module, and they can form part of a separate module on Internet/Online safety awareness.     1.1. Basic Concepts in Information Security     What is information ?    Generally, information is defined as the result of mental activity; it is an intangible product  that is transmitted through media. In the field of ICT, information is the result of processing,  manipulating and organizing data, which is simply a collecti on of facts.     In the field of Information Security, information is defined as an “asset”; it is something that  has value and should therefore be protected. The definition of information and information  security in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is used throughout this module.

These risks that are attendant on  informatization are discussed in section 2 of this module.     The negative aspects of information -oriented environments include the following:     Increase in unethical behavior  arising from anonymity  – ICT can be used to maintain  anonymity, which makes it easy for certain individuals to engage in unethical and  criminal  behavior , including illegal acquisition of information.     Conflicts over ownership and control of information  – Complications caused by  ownership and control of information have increased with the expansion of informatization.  For example, as gove rnments seek to build a personal information database under the  umbrella of e -government, some sectors have expressed concern over the possibility of  invasion of privacy from the disclosure of personal information to other parties.     Information and wealth gaps between classes and countries  – The size of information  asset holdings can be the barometer of wealth in knowledge/information -oriented societies.

Growing information exposure caused by advanced networks  – The  knowledge/information -oriented society is a network society.

Information security is defined as the preservation of confidentiality, integrity  and availability  of information.1 It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of  unauthorized/inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion/destruction,  corruption, modification, inspection, recording or devaluatio n, although it may also involve  reducing the adverse impacts of incidents. Information may take any form, e.g. , electronic  or physical, tangible (e.g. paperwork) or intangible (e.g. knowledge).     Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity  and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a  focus on efficient  policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.      Cyber Security , in contrast , includes not only information security, but also digital  infrastructure security, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems  and Internet -of-Things (IoT) systems , which goes beyond the protection of valuable  information.     4Rs of information security     The 4Rs of information security are Right Information, Right People, Right Time and Right  Form",What is the growing consensus regarding information?,"['Information needs to be protected.', 'Information is more valuable than tangible assets.', 'Information should be freely accessible to all.', 'Information is less valuable than tangible assets.']",0,Information_Security.pdf

Retrieved from https://www.iso.org/standard/73906.html      4   “Right People” means that information is available only to authorized individuals, which  guarantees confidentiality.     “Right Time” refers to the accessibility of information and its usability upon demand by an  authorized entity. This guarantees availability.     “Right Form” refers to providing information in the right format.     To safeguard information security, the 4Rs have to be applied properly. This means that  confidentiality, integrity and availability should be observed when handling information.     Figure 2: Correlation between risk and information assets         Information security also requires a clear understanding of the value of information assets,  as well as their vulnerabilities and corresponding threats. This is known as risk management.  Figure 2 above shows the correlation between information assets and risk.     Risk is determined by the asset value, threats and vulnerabilities. The formula is as follows:  Risk = ∫( Asset Value, Threats, Vulnerabilities)     Risk is directly proportional to asset value, threats and vulnerabilities. Thus, the risk can be  increased or decreased by manipulating the size of the asset value, threats and  vulnerabilities. This can be done throu gh risk management.   The methods of risk management are as follows:     Risk reduction (risk mitigation)  – This is done when the likelihood of threats/vulnerabilities  is high , but their effect is low. It involves understanding what the threats and vulnerabilit ies  are, altering or reducing them, and implementing a countermeasure. However, risk reduction  does not reduce the value of risk to “0”.       5   Risk acceptance  – This is done when the likelihood of threats/vulnerabilities is low and their  likely impact is minor or acceptable.     Risk transference  – If the risk is excessively high or the organization is not able to prepare  the necessary controls, the risk can be transferred outside of the organization. An example  is taking out an insurance policy.     Risk avoidance  – If the threats and vulnerabilities are highly likely to occur and the impact  is also extremely high, it is best to avoid the risk by outsourcing data processing equipment  and staff, for example.       Figure 3: Methods of R isk Management         Figure 3 above is a graphic representation of these four methods of risk management. In  this figure, the quadrant marked “1” is risk reduction, “2” is risk acceptance, “3” is risk  transference and “4” is risk avoidance.     A key consideration in choosing the appropriate risk management method is cost - effectiveness.

Standards for Information  Security Activities     Information security activities cannot be effectively performed without the mobilization of a  unified administrative, physical and technical plan.

This means that  confidentiality, integrity and availability should be observed when handling information.     Figure 2: Correlation between risk and information assets         Information security also requires a clear understanding of the value of information assets,  as well as their vulnerabilities and corresponding threats. This is known as risk management.  Figure 2 above shows the correlation between information assets and risk.     Risk is determined by the asset value, threats and vulnerabilities. The formula is as follows:  Risk = ∫( Asset Value, Threats, Vulnerabilities)     Risk is directly proportional to asset value, threats and vulnerabilities. Thus, the risk can be  increased or decreased by manipulating the size of the asset value, threats and  vulnerabilities. This can be done throu gh risk management.   The methods of risk management are as follows:     Risk reduction (risk mitigation)  – This is done when the likelihood of threats/vulnerabilities  is high , but their effect is low. It involves understanding what the threats and vulnerabilit ies  are, altering or reducing them, and implementing a countermeasure. However, risk reduction  does not reduce the value of risk to “0”.       5   Risk acceptance  – This is done when the likelihood of threats/vulnerabilities is low and their  likely impact is minor or acceptable.     Risk transference  – If the risk is excessively high or the organization is not able to prepare  the necessary controls, the risk can be transferred outside of the organization. An example  is taking out an insurance policy.     Risk avoidance  – If the threats and vulnerabilities are highly likely to occur and the impact  is also extremely high, it is best to avoid the risk by outsourcing data processing equipment  and staff, for example.       Figure 3: Methods of R isk Management         Figure 3 above is a graphic representation of these four methods of risk management. In  this figure, the quadrant marked “1” is risk reduction, “2” is risk acceptance, “3” is risk  transference and “4” is risk avoidance.

Types of Cyber Threats     External Threats     External threats are attacks that are conducted from non -employees and the attacks are usually  done remotely from outside the organization’s office. Examples of such threats include hacking,  denial o f service and malware.     Internal Threats     Internal threats are attacks that are conducted by employees or contractors who have physical  access to the organization’s systems, networks and applications. Such attacks are usually  carried out by disgruntled emp loyees/contractors. Internal attacks can also be unknowingly  facilitated by employees/contractors using social engineering and exploiting less security aware  employees.     2.2. Types of External Threats     Hacking     Hacking is the act of gaining access to a computer or computer network to obtain or modify  information without legal authorization.     Hacking can be classified as recreational, criminal or political hacking, depending on the  purpose of the attack. Recreational hacking is unauthorized modification of programs and data  simply to satisfy the hacker’s curiosity. Criminal hacking is used in fraud or espionage. Political  hacking is tampering with websites to broadcast unauthorized political messages.     Recently, hacking4 has become more and more implicated in cyber terrorism and cyberwarfare,  posing a major threat to national security. Another new trend shows hacking groups targeting  major sites with national interest and holding highly sensitive information.     4 Cross, D. (2017, January 10).

Distributed Denial -of-Service (DDoS) attacks are where multiple participating devices engage  in DoS attac ks from a distributed assortment of location.     The specific attack traffic or vulnerability exploitation that causes the target(s) to become  unresponsive is typically the same for both DDoS and DoS attacks. The distributed sources  engaged in the DDoS attac k often make the attack more difficult to defend against and are  generally more successful against larger and faster responding targets.5             Case Study 1:  Global websites suffering DDoS attack          5 SecureAuth.

They infiltrated all 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s server computers  and were able to view all the personal information of the account holders.     The hackers stole basic information, such as names, phone numbers, email  addresses and home addresses.   Email Spam     Spam is a bulk, unsolicited, commercial electronic message delivered through information  communication service such as e -mail. Spam is a low -cost and effective medium for advertising.  Recently, spam has been used to spread malicious code or seize personal information. Sometimes,  this type of spam is sent from zombie PCs that are, in most cases , infected by malicious codes.     In October 2016, cybercriminals launched major DDoS attacks, disrupting a host of websites,  including Twitter, Netflix, PayPal, Pinterest and the PlayStation Network, amongst many others.     The attack was staggering for its s ize, at one time measuring close to 1 Tbps. The group behind the  attack did this by compromising twenty thousand of endpoint IoT devices, transforming them in a  botnet and essentially flooding traffic to DNS hosting provider Dyn.

Examples of such threats include hacking,  denial o f service and malware.     Internal Threats     Internal threats are attacks that are conducted by employees or contractors who have physical  access to the organization’s systems, networks and applications.

Hacking can be classified as recreational, criminal or political hacking, depending on the  purpose of the attack. Recreational hacking is unauthorized modification of programs and data  simply to satisfy the hacker’s curiosity. Criminal hacking is used in fraud or espionage.

(2017, July 14). secureauth_ciam_infographic_170714.pdf. Irvine.    The JPMorgan Chase Bank Hacked     More than 80 million user accounts got revealed to hackers in 2014.     A Russian hacker group has hit one of the largest banks in the United States of  America. They managed to b reach 76 million personal accounts and 7 million small  business accounts. They infiltrated all 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s server computers  and were able to view all the personal information of the account holders.     The hackers stole basic information, such as names, phone numbers, email  addresses and home addresses.   Email Spam     Spam is a bulk, unsolicited, commercial electronic message delivered through information  communication service such as e -mail. Spam is a low -cost and effective medium for advertising.  Recently, spam has been used to spread malicious code or seize personal information. Sometimes,  this type of spam is sent from zombie PCs that are, in most cases , infected by malicious codes.     In October 2016, cybercriminals launched major DDoS attacks, disrupting a host of websites,  including Twitter, Netflix, PayPal, Pinterest and the PlayStation Network, amongst many others.     The attack was staggering for its s ize, at one time measuring close to 1 Tbps. The group behind the  attack did this by compromising twenty thousand of endpoint IoT devices, transforming them in a  botnet and essentially flooding traffic to DNS hosting provider Dyn.

About 2,600 phishing pages that mimicked banking websites were analysed by the Met Police Central  e-Crime Unit (PCeU), the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the US Secret Service.     The men behind the scam were traced to the U nited Kingdom , where they stayed in plush hotels in  London while continuing to scam victims.     Officers later discovered servers containing details of 30,000 bank customers, 12,500 of which were  in the U nited Kingdom , and 70 million customer email addresses to be used in phishing scams.     The men were  jailed  in 2016  for a total of 20 years.

"Rogue employees,  especially members of the IT team with knowledge of and access to networks, data centers  and admin accounts, can cause serious damage to an organizations network, systems and  data.     Lack of employee security awareness     Security awareness training for employees helps to eradicate risky behaviors that could  potentially lea d to cyber breaches. Training programs could address some of the threats faced  by an organization, especially attacks such as phishing emails, ransomware, and social  engineering scams via the telephone, text message, or social media channels.    16     Social engineering     The term “social engineering” refers to a set of techniques used to manipulate people into  divulging confidential information. Although it is similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the  term typically applies to trickery for information  gathering or computer system access. In most  cases the attacker never comes face -to-face with the victim.       2.4. Trends in Information Security Threats8    An important activity in safeguarding information security is security threat trend analysis. This  refers to the search for patterns in security threats over time in order to identify the ways in  which such patterns change and develop, veer to new directio ns, or shift. This iterative process  of collecting and correlating information and improving incident profiles is done to be able to  anticipate likely or possible threats and prepare the appropriate responses to these threats.     Organizations that perform i nformation security threat trend analysis and share security threat  trend reports include:     • FireEye (https://www.fireeye.com/current -threats/threat -intelligence - reports.html)   • IBM (https://www.ibm.com/security/data -breach/threat -intelligence /)   • Microsoft ( www.microsoft.com/en -us/security/operations/security - intelligence -report)   • Symantec (https://www.symantec.com/security -center/threat -report)   • Verizon (https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)     Trends in information security threats that have been reported are described below.     Automation of attack tools9    Intruders now use automated tools that allow them to gather information about thousands of  Internet hosts quickly and easily. Networks can be scanned from a remote location and hosts  with specific weaknesses identified using these automated tools. The intruders catalogue the  information for later use, share or trade it with other intruders, or attack immediately. Some  tools (such as Cain & Abel) automate a series of small attacks towar ds an overall objective. For  example, intruders can use a packet sniffer to obtain router or firewall passwords, log in to the  firewall to disable filters, and then use a network file service to read data on a server.     Attack tools that are difficult to de tect      8 Shimeall, T. J., & Williams, P. (2002). Models of information security trend analysis.

Software Engineering Institute . The CERT Division.  https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm.   .   17   Some attack tools use new attack patterns that are not detected by existing detection tools. For  example, anti -forensic techniques are being used to mask or hide the nature of attack tools.  Polymorphic tools change the form each time they are used. S ome of these tools use common  protocols like the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), making it difficult to distinguish them from  legitimate network traffic.10 The MSN Messenger worm is a good example of this. A worm in  the MSN Messenger Instant -Messaging (IM) client sends to contacts from the infected user’s  address book a file designed to infect systems, after first issuing a warning that they are about  to rec eive a file. The behavior  of a real IM user is mimicked, which is alarming.11    Faster discovery of vulnerabilities     Every year the newly discovered vulnerabilities in software products that are reported to the  Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) are more than doubles  in number, making it difficult for administrators to keep up to date  with patches. Intruders know  this and take advantage",What are some trends in information security threats that have been reported?,"['Automation of attack tools, faster discovery of vulnerabilities, and attack tools that are difficult to detect.', 'Social engineering, polymorphic tools, and anti-forensic techniques.', 'Phishing emails, ransomware, and social engineering scams via telephone, text message, or social media channels.', 'Increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by cybercriminals, the rise of cloud-based attacks, and the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.']",0,Information_Security.pdf
"The behavior  of a real IM user is mimicked, which is alarming.11    Faster discovery of vulnerabilities     Every year the newly discovered vulnerabilities in software products that are reported to the  Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) are more than doubles  in number, making it difficult for administrators to keep up to date  with patches. Intruders know  this and take advantage.12 Some intruders launch a zero -day (or zero hour ) attack, which is a  computer threat that expl oits computer application vulnerabilities for which there are no patches  or protection because they have not yet been discovered by administrators.13    Increasing asymmetric threat and convergence of attack methods     An asymmetric threat is a condition in wh ich an attacker has the edge over a defender. The  number of asymmetric threats increases with the automation of threat deployment and  sophistication of attack tools.     Convergence of attack methods refers to the consolidation of diverse attack methods by  attackers to create global networks that support coordinated malicious activity. For example,  Zbot, known as Zeus, is a malware package that is readily available for sale and also traded in  underground forums. The package contains a builder that  can generate a bot executable and  Web server files (PHP, images, SQL templates) for use as the command and control server.  While Zbot is a generic back door that allows full control by an unauthorized remote user, the  primary function of Zbot is financial  gain—stealing online credentials such as FTP, e -mail,  online banking, and other online passwords.14    10 Ramasubramanian, S., Ansari, S., & Purcell, F.

They are  a concern because of the number of organizations and users on the Internet and the increasing  amount of personal data on the Internet to carry out day -to-day business. Infrastructure attacks  result in compromise of sensitive information, spread of misinforma tion, and significant  diversion of resources from other tasks.     Hacking is an example of an infrastructure attack. The term “hacking” refers to the act of gaining  access to a computer or computer network to obtain or modify information without legal  author ization.   Hacking can be classified as recreational, criminal or political hacking, depending on the  purpose of the attack. Recreational hacking is unauthorized modification of programs and data  simply to satisfy the hacker’s curiosity. Criminal hacking is used in fraud or espionage. Political  hacking is tampering with websites to broadcast unauthorized political messages.15    Recently, hacking has become more and more implicated in cyberterror, cyberpolitics and  cyberwarfare, posing a major threat to nationa l security.     Another new trend shows hacking groups targeting major sites with national interest and  holding highly sensitive information.     Figure 4 shows the trend in data breach volumes.

Now, the purpose is usually money, slander and destruction. Moreover, these  types of attacks represent only a small portion of the broad spectrum of cybercrime.     Cybercrime is the deliberate destruction, disruption or distortion of digital data or information  flows  for political, economic, religious or ideological reasons. The most common crimes include  hacking, DoS, malicious code and social engineering. Recently, cybercrime has become part  of cyber terrorism and cyberwarfare, with adverse effects on national secur ity.    Table 3 below shows what perpetrators of cybercrime earn.      Technical: Tools and techniques to identify and gather information about active botnets   • Information security and privacy best practices to mitigate botnet  activity   • Registrar and registry best practices to mitigate botnet  activity   • Capacity building for e -commerce and online transaction  providers     Social: Broad -based education initiatives on Internet safety and security   • Facilitation of secure ICT access for  users     The PTF ITU SPAM toolkit  is a comprehensive  package  to help policy  planners,  regulators  and companies  adjust  policy  and recover  confidence  in e-mail.  The toolkit  also recommends  sharing of information across countries to prevent international  problems.    The Attorney General's Office of the Republic of Indonesia is institutionally strengthening  and  revitalizing  the institution  by preparing,  designing  and formulating Cybercrime Task Force,  which will consist of prosecutors who specifically have knowledge, abilities, skills and  expertise in handling cybercrime  cases.     The Task Force will consist of three special units, namely:   ▪ First, Computer R elated Crime Unit, assigned to handle criminal cases that utilize  computers or information technology facilities as a means of committing crimes,   ▪ Second, Crimes Against Computer Unit, assigned to handle crimes aimed at  computers and information technology;  and   ▪ Third, Cooperation and Secretariat Unit, providing support in handling cases and  cooperation both nationally and internationally.    20   Table 3: Returns from cybercrime in 2017   Item Price Ranges (in USD)   General non -financial institution login  credentials  1  Credit or Debit Card  5-110  Driver’s  License, Loyalty accounts  20  Online payment services login info e.g.  Paypal  20-200  Diplomas  100-400  Medical Records  1-1,000  Passports  1,000-2,000  Source : Experian   Stack, B.

It is helpful to begin a security improvement  programme by determining the current state of  security. Integral to a security programme are documented policies and procedures, as well as  technology that supports their implementation.     Administrative security     Administrative security consists of an inf ormation security strategy, policy and guidelines.
