Anchor the plant: Roots anchor the plant in the soil, preventing it from being uprooted by wind or other external forces.\r\n3. Storage of food: Roots can store food in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and other nutrients that the plant may need during times of drought or stress.\r\n4. Production of hormones: Roots produce hormones that help regulate the plant's growth and development, such as auxins, which control cell elongation and cell division.\r\n5.
