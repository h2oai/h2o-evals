Additionally, poor records management can undermine internal controls, making it challenging to ensure that financial transactions are properly authorized, recorded, and reported.

This approach focuses on the usefulness of the work performed, rather than just the amount of money spent, and aligns with the broader trend of performance budgeting and zero-based budgeting. Additionally, the adoption of accrual accounting in the public sector is a result of governments developing more business-type functions and operating services on a commercial basis, which requires a more sophisticated accounting system that can accurately reflect the financial transactions proper to the period of the account."

                        "Accruals accounting recognizes transactions when they occur, regardless of when cash is paid or received, and financial management systems that create records and depend on records facilitate economic decision making by making it easier to account for the use of resources, focus on performance and measure outputs. Well-managed records provide an unbiased account of responsibility and liability, and support accounting and auditing functions by providing an unambiguous link between the authorization to carry out a transaction, the particular individual concerned, and the date. Records management also reinforces financial management controls and supports accountability, and they play a critical role in enforcing accountability and control, risk assessment, decision making, and economic decision making. However, implementing effective record management in countries operating the Exchequer system of financial management can be challenging due to the diversity of practice and lack of centralization. A records management program can ensure that records providing evidence of financial management activity are systematically controlled throughout the organization by ensuring that those records are properly created, captured, organized, stored, retrieved, and disposed of."

In contrast, cash accounting only recognises transactions when cash is received or paid. The shift from cash to accruals accounting allows for a more accurate reflection of a government's financial position and performance, as it takes into account future obligations to pay and payments to be received in the future. This approach also enables better management of financial resources, as it allows governments to plan and budget for future expenses and revenues. Additionally, accruals accounting aligns with the principles of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), which enhances transparency and accountability in financial reporting."
