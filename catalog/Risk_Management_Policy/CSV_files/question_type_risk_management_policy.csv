Risk Management Policy.pdf,"How does the likelihood of a risk being realized relate to its residual risk rating, and how do current and future controls impact the assessment of residual risk?","The likelihood of a risk being realized is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being very probable and 1 being improbable. The residual risk rating is determined by considering the impact and likelihood of a risk, and it represents the level of risk that remains after current controls have been implemented. Current controls are measures or actions that are already in place to mitigate risk, while future controls are measures or actions that have been identified to be implemented to further reduce risk. The assessment of residual risk takes into account both current and future controls, and it is important to note that a future control becomes a current control once it has been fully implemented. The residual risk rating can be reduced by implementing effective controls, and if a risk has a residual risk rating of 3 or less, it may be removed from the risk register after two review periods if the register owner is satisfied that the risk is being managed and maintained at a minor score level.",multi-hop reasoning
Risk Management Policy.pdf,"How does the risk assessment exercise consider the effectiveness of current and future controls in reducing the likelihood and impact of potential risks, and how are these controls distinguished in the risk register?","The risk assessment exercise considers the effectiveness of current and future controls by assessing the residual risk score, which is the risk rating after considering the current controls. Future controls are identified to reduce the residual risk score further. The controls are distinguished in the risk register by their characteristics, such as action, owner, and timeline. Current controls are already implemented, while future controls are planned and require an action item to be implemented.",multi-hop reasoning

Risk Management Policy.pdf,"What is the likelihood of a risk being realized, taking into account the controls that are in place and the potential impact on the university, and how often should the risk assessment be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of these controls?","The likelihood of a risk being realized can be determined by analyzing the frequency of occurrence, impact, and likelihood ratings. The risk assessment should be conducted at least annually, both at the inherent and residual risk levels, to ensure the effectiveness of the controls and to identify any new risks that may have arisen. The assessment should also take into account the potential impact on the university, such as reduced research income, delayed academic processes, injury, and reputational damage. Additionally, the controls that are in place, such as policies, procedures, practices, processes, or technology, should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they are effective in mitigating the identified risks.",multi-hop reasoning

Risk Management Policy.pdf,"What is the procedure for managing risks that have a Residual Risk rating of 3 or less, and how does it involve the Executive Committee, Dean of Faculty or Director of Department, Head of Department/Unit, and Line Manager?","Risks with a Residual Risk rating of 3 or less should remain as identified risks for two review periods. At the end of the second review, if the Register Owner is satisfied that the residual risk is being managed and maintained at the minor score level, then the risk may be removed from the Register. The Executive Committee must be informed immediately if the residual risk is deemed to be extreme, and action must be taken immediately to either moderate the risk or close the activity/project. Serious risks require careful ongoing management with frequent evaluations of the risk factors by the manager of the area who is a member of the Executive Committee to restore them to more acceptable levels of risk. They should be reported to the Executive Committee at its bi-annual risk management meetings. Moderate levels of risk may be acceptable for certain projects and require approval of the Head of Department/Unit prior to commencing the activity/project or to allow the project/activity to continue. Re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated. Minor risks are the lowest and most tolerable level of risk, and student projects and individual staff research should carry no higher than tolerable risk without the express approval of the Head of Department/Unit. Re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated.",multi-hop reasoning
Risk Management Policy.pdf,"What is the Residual Risk Heat Map, and how is it used in the assessment of Risk in the financial area?","The Residual Risk Heat Map is a tool used to assess the level of risk remaining after controls have been implemented. It is used in conjunction with the Risk & Control Template to evaluate the effectiveness of controls and to identify areas where additional controls may be needed. In the financial area, the Residual Risk Heat Map is used to assess the level of risk associated with budget management. The map is divided into four quadrants: extreme, serious, moderate, and minor. The level of risk is determined by evaluating the impact and likelihood of a potential risk, and then plotting it on the map. The map helps to identify areas where risk is not being managed effectively and where additional controls need to be implemented.",multi-hop reasoning

Risk Management Policy.pdf,What is the procedure for managing and monitoring risks at the University of Limerick?,"The University of Limerick has a Risk Register that is a risk recording and monitoring tool for the management of the university. It is a hierarchical entity, for example, the University‚Äôs Fundamental Risk Register is informed by Faculty/Division Risk Registers. The Risk Register Template is set out in Appendix 2. The procedure for managing and monitoring risks at the University of Limerick involves identifying the risk, assessing the impact and likelihood of the risk, and determining the residual risk rating. The residual risk rating is determined by the impact and likelihood of the risk after considering the current controls in place. The risk is then assigned a risk owner, and future controls and actions required are identified. The risk is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the residual risk rating remains acceptable. If the residual risk rating is extreme, immediate action is required, and the Executive Committee must be informed. If the residual risk rating is serious, it requires careful ongoing management with frequent evaluation of the risk factors. Risks at this level should be reported to the Executive Committee at its bi-annual risk management meetings. If the residual risk rating is moderate, it may be acceptable for certain projects, and the Head of Department/Unit must approve the activity/project prior to commencing. Re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated. If the residual risk rating is minor, it is the lowest and most tolerable level of risk, and re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated.",multi-hop reasoning

Risk Management Policy.pdf,"What is the purpose of the Residual Risk Heat Map, and how does it relate to the overall risk management process at the University of Limerick?","The Residual Risk Heat Map is a tool used in the risk management process at the University of Limerick to assess the residual risk rating of a risk after controls have been implemented. It helps to identify whether the risk has been reduced to an acceptable level, and it plays a crucial role in the assessment of risk, particularly in the financial area. The map is used to evaluate the impact and likelihood of a risk, and it helps to identify the level of reporting required for each risk. The map is also used to monitor and review risks over time, ensuring that they are being managed and maintained at an acceptable level. By using the Residual Risk Heat Map, the University can effectively manage risks and minimize their impact on the institution.",multi-hop reasoning
