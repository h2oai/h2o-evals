Explorers, on the other hand, work in a more random manner and do not know what they are looking for at the outset of the analysis. They require a more flexible and adaptive approach to data analysis, which may involve using techniques such as data mining or machine learning to discover patterns and relationships in large datasets. This has implications for IT architecture and data management, as it requires a more sophisticated and flexible infrastructure to support the needs of explorers. The use of ODS can help to address these needs by providing a consolidated view of current data that can be easily accessed and analyzed, but the IT architecture must also be designed to accommodate the more random and unpredictable nature of exploratory analysis."

This can lead to a lack of efficient information handling and sorting, resulting in poor customer relationships and inefficiencies. To address this problem, IT support systems and information handling can be improved by implementing solutions such as operational data stores, business process execution language, business rules engines, and questionnaire techniques. Additionally, conducting interviews and observations of customer service representatives and senior IT architects can provide valuable insights into the problem and help identify effective solutions."
