For example, the Army has specific requirements for government-designed projects, classified infrastructure, telecommunications spaces, and fiber optic backbone cable. The Navy has specific requirements for collocating various systems, bachelor quarters considerations, fiber optic backbone cabling, and outside cable plant. The Air Force and USMC have reserved sections for their specific requirements.

The different branches of the military have different requirements, which are detailed in Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the document. Not following these requirements can result in non-compliance with industry standards, inefficient use of available funds and resources, and failure to meet the needs of the project. The Test Plan ensures that these requirements are met by providing a comprehensive plan for testing the telecommunications system, including the unshielded twisted pair (CAT6) cabling and connecting hardware, fiber optic cabling and connecting hardware, coaxial cabling and connecting hardware, and other system requirements. The Test Plan also includes provisions for grounding, bonding, and static protection, as well as telecommunications system administration and testing."
