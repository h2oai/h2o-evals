In light of the Constitutional Court's judgement in the New Nation Movement NPC and Others v the President of South Africa matter, the minimalist model addresses the defects of the Electoral Act 73 of 1998 by allowing adult citizens to be elected to the National Assembly (NA) and Provincial Legislatures (PLs) through means other than their membership in political parties. This model does not interfere with the constitutionally required general proportionality and can be achieved without significant changes to the existing legislation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the minimalist model aligns with the principles of equality, non-discrimination, and human dignity as encapsulated in the Constitution of RSA, which is also reflected in the White Paper on Marriages and the Official Identity Management (OIM) Policy. Moreover, the minimalist model's emphasis on proportional representation can contribute to the development of a new single legislation that will regulate all marriages in SA, as it ensures that diverse voices and perspectives are represented in the legislative process.

How does the Department of Home Affairs' use of BBBEE and BEC impact the country's ability to effectively manage its borders and promote economic growth?,"The Department of Home Affairs' use of BBBEE and BEC can impact the country's ability to effectively manage its borders and promote economic growth in several ways.
