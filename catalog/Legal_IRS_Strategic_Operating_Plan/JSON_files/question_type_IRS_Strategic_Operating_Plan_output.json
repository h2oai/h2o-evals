The agency is developing a Strategic Operating Plan to deploy the investments in the IRA to better serve taxpayers, tax professionals, and the broader tax ecosystem. The plan includes initiatives such as modernizing technology, improving service to taxpayers, enhancing enforcement, and attracting and retaining a skilled workforce. The IRS is also working to improve its ability to address the tax gap by enhancing its compliance and enforcement efforts, including expanding enforcement on taxpayers with complex tax filings and high-dollar noncompliance. Additionally, the IRS is investing in new technologies and data analytics to better identify and address tax fraud and errors."

By enabling secure electronic filing and processing for IRS documents, Initiative 1.2 helps reduce delays and errors in processing, which can disproportionately affect taxpayers in rural areas, with disabilities, or with limited English proficiency. Additionally, Initiative 1.2's emphasis on digitalization can help reduce the environmental impact of the IRS's operations, which can contribute to long-term sustainability. The integration of Initiative 1.2's digital services and digitalization with Initiative 1.1's focus on equitable access can lead to a more efficient and sustainable IRS operation by reducing paper usage, minimizing the need for shipping, and streamlining the processing of taxpayer documents."

Additionally, Initiative 1.2 will ensure that taxpayers claiming credits are able to securely file digitally and are not unduly burdened during filing. To support this, Initiative 1.2 will scan and digitalize all incoming paper forms, returns, and communications to process them digitally. Furthermore, Initiative 1.2 will modernize forms and other documents to make them mobile-friendly, shifting away from the structure of traditional paper forms toward easy-to-use, interactive forms that can be easily updated and improved in response to changes in customer needs and tax laws.
