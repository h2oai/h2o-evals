In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we  recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023.

In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we  recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur  additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.

Stock Repurchases On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional  $70.0 billion  of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its  stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading  prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to  time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market  purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

"Prior periods have  been recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below . As announced on April 20, 2023 , we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind  to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change does not affect first quarter reporting. The group, called  Google DeepMind, will be reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs beginning in the second quarter of  2023. Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2023 (recast) Operating income (loss): Google Services $ 21,973 $ 21,737  Google Cloud  (706)  191  Other Bets  (835)  (1,225)  Corporate costs, unallocated(1) (338)  (3,288)  Total income from operations $ 20,094 $ 17,415  (1)Hedging gains (losses) related to revenue included in unallocated corporate costs were $278 million  and $84 million  for the  three months ended March 31, 2022  and 2023 , respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated  corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion .  2Additional information  relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023  (unaudited) Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we  recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs  associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we  recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur  additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. These severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three  months ended March 31, 2023  as follows (in millions): Severance and  Related Office Space Total Cost of revenues $ 461 $ 220 $ 681  Research and development  835  247  1,082  Sales and marketing  445  35  480  General and administrative  253  62  315  Total charges $ 1,994 $ 564 $ 2,558  For segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included withi n unallocated corporate costs in  our segment results. Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and  adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain  network equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal  year 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023  was a reduction in depreciation expense of  $988 million  and an increase in net income of $770 million , or $0.06  per basic and $0.06  per diluted share . Timing of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to  March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full  fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining  quarters of the year. Stock Repurchases On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional  $70.0 billion  of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its  stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading  prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to  time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market  purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

* ""What was"" is a more concise way of asking for information than ""What was the operating expenses for.""
* ""Tesla's"" can be used instead of ""Tesla"" to make the question more concise.
* ""Q1 2023"" is a commonly used abbreviation for the first quarter of 2023, which makes the question shorter.
