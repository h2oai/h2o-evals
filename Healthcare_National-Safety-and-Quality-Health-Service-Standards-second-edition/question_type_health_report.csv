They can also facilitate access to services and facilities by using clear signage and directions, providing flexible visiting arrangements, and demonstrating a welcoming environment that recognizes the cultural beliefs and practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This can be achieved by partnering with consumers in the design and governance of the organization, communicating with patients in a way that supports effective partnerships, and providing care that is respectful, sharing information in an ongoing way, working with patients, carers, and families to make decisions and plan care, and supporting and encouraging patients in their own care.",multi-hop reasoning
National-Safety-and-Quality-Health-Service-Standards-second-edition.pdf,"How does the Partnering with Consumers Standard of the NSQHS Standards support the delivery of care that is based on partnerships, and what role does effective communication play in this process?","The Partnering with Consumers Standard supports the delivery of care that is based on partnerships by providing systems that are designed and used to support patients, carers, families, and consumers to be partners in healthcare planning, design, measurement, and evaluation. Effective communication is essential in this process as it supports the workforce to form partnerships with patients and carers, enabling patients to be actively involved in their own care. The health service organisation uses a charter of rights that is consistent with the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights and ensures that its informed consent processes comply with legislation and best practice. Additionally, the health service organisation has processes to identify the capacity of a patient to make decisions about their own care and a substitute decision-maker if a patient does not have the capacity to make decisions for themselves. The health service organisation supports the workforce to form partnerships with patients and carers so that patients can be actively involved in their own care, and clinicians partner with patients and/or their substitute decision-maker to plan, communicate, set goals, and make decisions about their current and future care.",multi-hop reasoning

Additionally, the standard requires health service organisations to provide a safe environment for the delivery of care, including maintaining buildings, plant, equipment, utilities, devices, and other infrastructure that are fit for purpose. The standard also encourages health service organisations to identify service areas that have a high risk of unpredictable behaviors and develop strategies to minimise the risks of harm for patients, carers, families, consumers, and the workforce. Furthermore, the standard promotes partnering with consumers in the design and governance of healthcare services by developing systems that support patients, carers, families, and consumers to be partners in healthcare planning, design, measurement, and evaluation. The standard also requires health service organisations to communicate with patients in a way that supports effective partnerships and to involve consumers in the design and governance of the organisation.",multi-hop reasoning
