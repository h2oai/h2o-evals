This aligns with the department's mandate to regulate the secure movement of people through ports of entry into and out of South Africa, as well as its objective to ensure that 95% of critical skills visa applications are adjudicated within 4 weeks. The e-Visa system also supports the department's efforts to modernize and coordinate border management, as outlined in the Border Management Act, 2020, by providing an integrated and automated platform for processing visa applications.

In light of the Constitutional Court's judgement in the New Nation Movement NPC and Others v the President of South Africa matter, the minimalist model addresses the defects of the Electoral Act 73 of 1998 by allowing adult citizens to be elected to the National Assembly (NA) and Provincial Legislatures (PLs) through means other than their membership in political parties. This model does not interfere with the constitutionally required general proportionality and can be achieved without significant changes to the existing legislation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the minimalist model aligns with the principles of equality, non-discrimination, and human dignity as encapsulated in the Constitution of RSA, which is also reflected in the White Paper on Marriages and the Official Identity Management (OIM) Policy. Moreover, the minimalist model's emphasis on proportional representation can contribute to the development of a new single legislation that will regulate all marriages in SA, as it ensures that diverse voices and perspectives are represented in the legislative process. The implications of the minimalist model on the development of a new single legislation on marriages in SA may include the inclusion of provisions that protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, religious, or cultural persuasions, and the establishment of a fair and transparent system for the appointment of marriage officers."

The BMA plays a critical role in the coordination of various government agencies and stakeholders to achieve this goal, as it is responsible for the implementation of the National Development Plan and the Medium Term Strategic Framework in relation to border management. The BMA's role in border management includes the management of ports of entry, border control, immigration services, and customs services, all of which are critical in ensuring the efficient and secure movement of people and goods across the country's borders. The BMA also works closely with other government agencies, such as the South African Police Service and the South African Revenue Service, to ensure that the country's borders are secure and that illegal activities, such as human trafficking and drug smuggling, are prevented. Additionally, the BMA is responsible for the management of the National Identification System, which is critical in ensuring that individuals entering the country are properly identified and documented. The BMA's role in the coordination of various government agencies and stakeholders is essential in ensuring that the country's borders are managed effectively and efficiently, which in turn contributes to the overall goal of improving the lives of citizens."
