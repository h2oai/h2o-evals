The Executive Committee must be informed immediately if the residual risk is deemed to be extreme, and action must be taken immediately to either moderate the risk or close the activity/project. Serious risks require careful ongoing management with frequent evaluations of the risk factors by the manager of the area who is a member of the Executive Committee to restore them to more acceptable levels of risk. They should be reported to the Executive Committee at its bi-annual risk management meetings. Moderate levels of risk may be acceptable for certain projects and require approval of the Head of Department/Unit prior to commencing the activity/project or to allow the project/activity to continue. Re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated. Minor risks are the lowest and most tolerable level of risk, and student projects and individual staff research should carry no higher than tolerable risk without the express approval of the Head of Department/Unit.

The Risk Register Template is set out in Appendix 2. The procedure for managing and monitoring risks at the University of Limerick involves identifying the risk, assessing the impact and likelihood of the risk, and determining the residual risk rating. The residual risk rating is determined by the impact and likelihood of the risk after considering the current controls in place. The risk is then assigned a risk owner, and future controls and actions required are identified. The risk is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the residual risk rating remains acceptable. If the residual risk rating is extreme, immediate action is required, and the Executive Committee must be informed. If the residual risk rating is serious, it requires careful ongoing management with frequent evaluation of the risk factors. Risks at this level should be reported to the Executive Committee at its bi-annual risk management meetings. If the residual risk rating is moderate, it may be acceptable for certain projects, and the Head of Department/Unit must approve the activity/project prior to commencing. Re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated. If the residual risk rating is minor, it is the lowest and most tolerable level of risk, and re-assessment of the risk factors should be conducted at regular intervals to assure stakeholders that the risk has not escalated."
