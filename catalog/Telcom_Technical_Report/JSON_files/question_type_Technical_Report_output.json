                    "expected_output": "DFS providers can mitigate account take over using intercepted OTP SMS by implementing a bidirectional authentication flow, where the user replies to an SMS with a code displayed on a view resource, and the DFS provider verifies the legitimacy of the reply SMS by looking at the SCCP meta-data. Additionally, DFS providers can detect and mitigate social engineering attacks with MT-USSD by using the SCCP meta-data to verify the global title (GT) of the USSD message and matching the user's location and home network. However, the challenges faced by DFS providers in implementing these strategies include the cost of implementation and the lack of regulation mandating it, as well as the fact that many DFS users do not own a smartphone and access the DFS via USSD or SMS, which makes it difficult to implement best of breed authentication and encryption mechanisms."
