Explain in detail, highlighting the various techniques used by attackers and the measures that can be taken to prevent such attacks.","A successful USSD phishing attack can be executed by attackers using various techniques such as social engineering, SIM card swap, SIM card recycle, and denial of service attacks. To protect themselves from such attacks, users should be cautious when receiving USSD messages and not divulge sensitive information such as account number and PIN code to anyone, especially not to someone who has contacted them via USSD. They should also verify the authenticity of the USSD message by contacting their financial service provider directly. Additionally, users should be aware of the risks of SIM card swap and SIM card recycle, and take measures to secure their SIM cards and DFS accounts. They should also be cautious of any suspicious activity on their accounts and report it immediately to their financial service provider. Furthermore, users should keep their phone software and operating system up to date, use strong and unique passwords, and use two-factor authentication whenever possible.",multi-hop reasoning
T-TUT-PROTO-2019-PDF-E.pdf,"How can an attacker use USSD to socially engineer sensitive credentials from a mobile subscriber, and what are the possible ways to execute and scale such an attack?","An attacker can use USSD to socially engineer sensitive credentials from a mobile subscriber by sending a phishing USSD message that spoofs the identity of the financial service provider, luring the user to divulge sensitive information such as account number and PIN code. This attack can be executed by sending a phishing USSD message as shown in Figure 8, which has no identification and is trusted by the user. Once the user divulges their account number and PIN, the attacker can log into the account and transfer funds out. The attack can be scaled by automating the process for a range of IMSIs, causing a network-wide outage.
