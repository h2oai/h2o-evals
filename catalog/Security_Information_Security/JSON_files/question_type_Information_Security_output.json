Internal threats are attacks that are conducted by employees or contractors who have physical access to the organization's systems, networks, and applications. They can be further classified into recreational, criminal, or political hacking. Recreational hacking is unauthorized modification of programs and data simply to satisfy the hacker's curiosity. Criminal hacking is used in fraud or espionage. Political hacking is tampering with websites to broadcast unauthorized political messages. Additionally, hacking has become more implicated in cyber terrorism and cyberwarfare, posing a major threat to national security. Another new trend shows hacking groups targeting major sites with national interest and holding highly sensitive information. To counter these threats, organizations should implement a comprehensive information security plan that includes administrative, physical, and technical controls to protect their information assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction."

The target learning outcomes for the module include the ability to define information security, privacy, and related concepts, identify threats to information security, assess existing information security policy in terms of international standards of information security and privacy protection, and formulate or make recommendations regarding information security policy that would be appropriate to their own context. The module's design and content support the achievement of these objectives by providing a clear and concise overview of the topics, using case studies and exercises to help deepen understanding of key concepts, and including references and online resources for further learning. Additionally, the module's online distance learning platform, the APCICT Virtual Academy, provides virtual classrooms featuring trainers' presentations in video format and PowerPoint presentations of the module, which can help learners to better understand the material and interact with the content in a more engaging way."
