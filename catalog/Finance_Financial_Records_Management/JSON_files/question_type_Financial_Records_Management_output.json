This approach focuses on the usefulness of the work performed, rather than just the amount of money spent, and aligns with the broader trend of performance budgeting and zero-based budgeting. Additionally, the adoption of accrual accounting in the public sector is a result of governments developing more business-type functions and operating services on a commercial basis, which requires a more sophisticated accounting system that can accurately reflect the financial transactions proper to the period of the account."
