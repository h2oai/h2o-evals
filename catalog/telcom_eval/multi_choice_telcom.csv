Due to the dominance of feature phones among users in developing  economies, which comprise the majority of DFS end -users, the communi cation channels in which the  end-user communicates with the DFS provider are mostly USSD, SMS  and sim tool kit (STK).  Moreover, today the signal ling network is not isolated, and this allows an intruder to exploit its flaws  and intercept calls and SMSs, byp ass billing, steal money from mobile accounts, or affect mobile  network communications even in developed countries .   USSD and SMS as means of communication have long been known to be  susceptible to attack and  have many published vulnerabilities. Exploiting  these vulnerabilities enables attackers to commit fraud  and steal funds from unsuspecting victims, who in most cases are unaware that their account is being  compromised or hacked.   This document intends to analyse  telecom vulnerabilities and their impact on digital financial services,  both on the end user 's side and the service provider 's side. This document helps DFS providers  understand the telecom vulnerability situation and create mitigation strategies to safeguard their clients.   6 Impact of telecom vulnerabilities  on DFS   Telecom vulnerabilities enable criminals to perform various attacks that result in fraud to steal digital  money . Many of these attacks involve the attacker masquerading as the DFS provider to defraud the  end-user or the attacker  masquerading as the end -user to defraud the DFS provider. In all these cases,  the attacker uses telecom vulnerabilities to pass authentication and perform actions on compromised  accounts  according to the examples given in clauses 6.1 to 7 .   6.1 Over the c ounter cash fraud   In this example, a fraudster walks up to a DFS agent (for example a seven -eleven branch) and requests  cash withdrawal from his account. The fraudster provides the victim 's account number to the agent,     TR-SS7-DFS  (2019)  3 when the agent initiates the transact ion, an SMS verification code is sent to the victim, however, this  verification SMS is intercepted by the fraudster, and used to complete the fraud and steal the money.   6.2 Account takeover   In this example, a fraudster uses USSD to takeover an account that  does not belong to him. To perform  this attack, the fraudster first needs to spoof his victim 's phone number and dial the USSD code (this  can be done by over the air interception – explained further in clause 7)","What is the significance of the term ""OTT"" in the context of DFS?","['OTT refers to Over-the-top services offered by DFS providers over the telecom infrastructure.', 'OTT refers to the method of hackers masquerading as DFS providers to defraud end-users.', 'OTT refers to the vulnerabilities in the signaling network that allows intruders to intercept calls and SMSs.', 'OTT refers to the means of communication used by end-users to communicate with DFS providers.']",0,T-TUT-PROTO-2019-PDF-E.pdf

To perform  this attack, the fraudster first needs to spoof his victim 's phone number and dial the USSD code (this  can be done by over the air interception – explained further in clause 7). Once the fraudster initiates  the USSD sess ion with the DFS provider spoofing the victim 's phone number , they can change the  PIN code and add another phone number to the account. Once done, the fraudster performs another  USSD session, this time with the new phone number they added and uses the new PIN to login to the  account and transfer the money out.   6.3 Social engineering   There are many ways of social engineering, in this example; the fraudster uses USSD to perform social  engineering that misleads the victim to give away the account number and PI N. To perform this attack,  the fraudster impersonates the DFS provider and sends a USSD message to the victim telling him that  there is a pending money transfer for his account, and in order to receive it the victim enters his account  number and PIN in the  USSD dialog. Once done, the attacker now has the victim 's account number  and PIN and can take over the victim 's account.   7 Telecom vulnerabilities and attack surfaces   Telecom vulnerabilities can be exploited through two attack surfaces , i.e.,  the SS7 network and the  cellular air interface:   • The SS7 network is a legacy signa lling network interconnecting all cellular operators in the  world , the SS7 protocol1 that is used for signa lling has been around since the 1980 's, and the  latest move to D iameter protocol2 (for 4G -LTE networks) did not solve any of the basic  vulnerabilities found in SS7.   • The cellular air interface (the radio frequency communication between the cell phone and the  cellular network) has been a major attack surface since the  inception of cellular  communications. Interception of these radio communications enable intelligence collection  and espionage capabilities without the requirement that the perpetrator have access to the  cellular network. Despite the evolution to newer gen erations of cellular networks (3G/4G)  with stronger security measures, most off -the-air interception systems have successfully  overcome these measures. Furthermore, even when 2G air interface encryption is easily  decrypted and open -source software to crack  the encryption is available; many 2G networks  remain active.   8 Common types of telecom attacks   Table 1 provides details of common types of telecom attacks.     1  A diagram of the SS7 protocol stack can be found in Annex A .  2  A diagram of the Diameter protocol stack can be found in Annex A .   4 TR-SS7-DFS  (2019)  Table 1 – Common types of telecom attacks   Attack  Description  Impact on DFS   Spam  Routing a short message to the mobile  terminating device has a cost, charged to the  sender.

An attacker can  top-up a sim card with another  subscriber 's identity and evade payment .  Location  tracking  An attacker can locate a target subscriber  based on MSISDN. As mobile networks need  to efficiently route messages to subscribers, the  home network knows where to send messages  to contact any given subscriber. In some cases,  the attacker does not even need to send  messages, since passive eavesdropping may  reveal the target location.

14,"6.2 Account takeover   In this example, a fraudster uses USSD to takeover an account that  does not belong to him. To perform  this attack, the fraudster first needs to spoof his victim 's phone number and dial the USSD code (this  can be done by over the air interception – explained further in clause 7). Once the fraudster initiates  the USSD sess ion with the DFS provider spoofing the victim 's phone number , they can change the  PIN code and add another phone number to the account. Once done, the fraudster performs another  USSD session, this time with the new phone number they added and uses the new PIN to login to the  account and transfer the money out.   6.3 Social engineering   There are many ways of social engineering, in this example; the fraudster uses USSD to perform social  engineering that misleads the victim to give away the account number and PI N. To perform this attack,  the fraudster impersonates the DFS provider and sends a USSD message to the victim telling him that  there is a pending money transfer for his account, and in order to receive it the victim enters his account  number and PIN in the  USSD dialog. Once done, the attacker now has the victim 's account number  and PIN and can take over the victim 's account.   7 Telecom vulnerabilities and attack surfaces   Telecom vulnerabilities can be exploited through two attack surfaces , i.e.,  the SS7 network and the  cellular air interface:   • The SS7 network is a legacy signa lling network interconnecting all cellular operators in the  world , the SS7 protocol1 that is used for signa lling has been around since the 1980 's, and the  latest move to D iameter protocol2 (for 4G -LTE networks) did not solve any of the basic  vulnerabilities found in SS7.   • The cellular air interface (the radio frequency communication between the cell phone and the  cellular network) has been a major attack surface since the  inception of cellular  communications. Interception of these radio communications enable intelligence collection  and espionage capabilities without the requirement that the perpetrator have access to the  cellular network. Despite the evolution to newer gen erations of cellular networks (3G/4G)  with stronger security measures, most off -the-air interception systems have successfully  overcome these measures. Furthermore, even when 2G air interface encryption is easily  decrypted and open -source software to crack  the encryption is available; many 2G networks  remain active.   8 Common types of telecom attacks   Table 1 provides details of common types of telecom attacks.     1  A diagram of the SS7 protocol stack can be found in Annex A .  2  A diagram of the Diameter protocol stack can be found in Annex A .   4 TR-SS7-DFS  (2019)  Table 1 – Common types of telecom attacks   Attack  Description  Impact on DFS   Spam  Routing a short message to the mobile  terminating device has a cost, charged to the  sender.

Due to the high level of assumed trust by the users (when receiving USSD  messages), the simplest attack to execute and scale an attack is using USSD to send a fraudulent  message to the user spoofing the identity of the financial service p rovider, luring the user to divulge  sensitive information such as account number and PIN code. For example, to phish these credentials,  the attacker sends a phishing USSD message  as shown in Figure  8.                 Figure 8 – Using USSD to socially engin eer the user     12 TR-SS7-DFS  (2019)  Since there is no identification in the USSD message, and the user is used to having these messages  from the network, trust is achieved, and the user divulges their account number and PIN. From there  on, the attacker logs into the account and transfers the funds out.   13.3 Denial of service attacks   Using SS7 an attacker can cause denial of service (DoS) for selected subscribers or cause a network  wide outage. There are various ways to create a DoS attack, for example , sending an update location  message with an out -of-network serving address will block all incoming calls and SMS from reaching  the subscriber . Deleting a subscriber 's record from the serving visitor location register  (VLR ) will  cause a DoS for a given subscriber until the rec ord is re -inserted to the VLR. Performing each attack  in scale (automatically for a range of IMSIs) can cause a network wide outage. However, in most  cases, since these SS7 DoS attacks are not affecting the radio network, performing an outgoing  transaction  such as placing a call or sending an SMS will reverse the effects of the DoS almost  immediately.   13.4 SIM card swap   Another way to takeover accounts is by performing a ""SIM swap "". An example of this attack is the  case that the attacker social engineers th e mobile carrier to issue them a SIM card belonging to the  victim, by impersonating the victim at a point of service, and claiming that they have lost the original  SIM card. If successful, they have obtained a cloned SIM. Once in possession of the cloned S IM, the  attacker accesses the DFS provider 's USSD menu and resets the PIN of the account. The attacker uses  the cloned SIM to receive the OTP SMS and confirms the new PIN. From there the attacker has  essentially taken over, can log in to the account and tr ansfers the funds out.   For example: An Airtel Money account wiped clean by the same tricksters8.  The fraudsters called the  customer on the pretext that they wanted to assist him with sim card registration and upgrade to fourth  generation (4G) technology.  In the course of the conversation, they asked him to dial *102#, the sim  swap code. The next thing he realized he could not receive or make calls and his Airtel Money account  was drained.   13.5 SIM card recycle   SIM card recycle is not an SS7 attack, but ra ther a lack of due care and due diligence by the DFS  provider that gives an unauthorized person access to funds belonging to other people.   The SIM recycle scenario is as follows:   • Person A is issued a prepaid SIM card and opens a DFS account using the as sociated phone  number.   • After a few months of usage, Person A stops topping -up the prepaid SIM card, meanwhile,  Person A still has a positive balance on this DFS account associated with the phone number .  • After a dormancy period usually (1 -6 months) of no usage and topping -up the SIM, the  network operator cancels the SIM , which will no longer be active, effectively disconnecting  Person A from the DFS account (which may still have funds).   • Person B is issued a new prepaid SIM card by the network operator  which has Person A 's  phone number (that 's the recycle action) .  • Person B can now access Person A 's DFS account and use whatever funds remained in person  A's account.     8  https://mwnation",What is the purpose of USSD in online banking and other financially sensitive applications?,"['To provide an additional layer of security for transactions.', 'To allow users to access their accounts from any device.', 'To enable the network operator to cancel a SIM card that has been inactive for a certain period.', 'To facilitate social engineering attacks by sending phishing USSD messages to users.']",3,T-TUT-PROTO-2019-PDF-E.pdf

The SIM recycle scenario is as follows:   • Person A is issued a prepaid SIM card and opens a DFS account using the as sociated phone  number.   • After a few months of usage, Person A stops topping -up the prepaid SIM card, meanwhile,  Person A still has a positive balance on this DFS account associated with the phone number .  • After a dormancy period usually (1 -6 months) of no usage and topping -up the SIM, the  network operator cancels the SIM , which will no longer be active, effectively disconnecting  Person A from the DFS account (which may still have funds).   • Person B is issued a new prepaid SIM card by the network operator  which has Person A 's  phone number (that 's the recycle action) .  • Person B can now access Person A 's DFS account and use whatever funds remained in person  A's account.     8  https://mwnation",How can an attacker cause denial of service (DoS) for selected subscribers or a network-wide outage using SS7?,"['By sending an update location message with an out-of-network serving address, blocking all incoming calls and SMS from reaching the subscriber.', ""By deleting a subscriber's record from the serving visitor location register (VLR), causing a DoS for a given subscriber until the record is reinserted into the VLR."", 'By performing an outgoing transaction such as placing a call or sending an SMS, which will reverse the effects of the DoS almost immediately.', 'By social engineering the mobile carrier to issue them a SIM card belonging to the victim, by impersonating the victim at a point of service, and claiming that they have lost the original SIM card.']",1,T-TUT-PROTO-2019-PDF-E.pdf

Once the DFS provider 's online  system verifies the code the  attacker typed, it allows the attacker to login to the victim 's account and  transfer funds.   13.2 Social engineering of sensitive credentials using USSD   Unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) is used for, online banking and other financially  sensit ive applications. Due to the high level of assumed trust by the users (when receiving USSD  messages), the simplest attack to execute and scale an attack is using USSD to send a fraudulent  message to the user spoofing the identity of the financial service p rovider, luring the user to divulge  sensitive information such as account number and PIN code. For example, to phish these credentials,  the attacker sends a phishing USSD message  as shown in Figure  8.

Deleting a subscriber 's record from the serving visitor location register  (VLR ) will  cause a DoS for a given subscriber until the rec ord is re -inserted to the VLR. Performing each attack  in scale (automatically for a range of IMSIs) can cause a network wide outage.

An example of this attack is the  case that the attacker social engineers th e mobile carrier to issue them a SIM card belonging to the  victim, by impersonating the victim at a point of service, and claiming that they have lost the original  SIM card. If successful, they have obtained a cloned SIM. Once in possession of the cloned S IM, the  attacker accesses the DFS provider 's USSD menu and resets the PIN of the account. The attacker uses  the cloned SIM to receive the OTP SMS and confirms the new PIN. From there the attacker has  essentially taken over, can log in to the account and tr ansfers the funds out.   For example: An Airtel Money account wiped clean by the same tricksters8.  The fraudsters called the  customer on the pretext that they wanted to assist him with sim card registration and upgrade to fourth  generation (4G) technology.

It should be seen as a toolbox  for operators, as not every measure mentioned in this document can be deployed in every network.   14.4 IR.88 LTE and EPC roaming guidelines   This document outlines LTE interconnect (roaming) security measures. It is the LTE counterpart to  the IR.82. It contains a security toolbox for Diameter, it covers aspects such as routing attacks, DoS,  location trac king and other types of diameter -based interconnection attacks on SCTP, GTP and  interface specific recommendation e.g. , S6a, S9, S8. It also tackles legacy interworking, SMS security  and charging and policy related security aspects.   14.5 Mitigations in GSM A documents vs common telecom attacks   Table 3 provides information on the c overage of mitigation strategies in GSMA documents vs   common SS7/Diameter attacks .      14 TR-SS7-DFS  (2019)  Table 3 – Coverage of mitigation strategies in GSMA documents vs   common SS7/Diameter attacks   Attack  FS.11 (2/3G)  FS.07 (2/3G)  IR.82 (2/3G)  IR.88 (4G)   Spam  🗙 ✓ ✓ 🗙  Spoofing  ✓ ✓ ✓ 🗙  Location tracking  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓  Subscriber fraud  🗙 ✓ ✓ ✓  Intercept  🗙 ✓ 🗙 🗙  Denial of service (DoS)  ✓ ✓ ✓ 🗙  Infiltration attacks  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓  Routing attacks  🗙 ✓ ✓ 🗙  15 Implementation of mitigation among mobile operators   Mobile operators have not really addressed the issue of SS7 telecom vulnerabilities",What is the purpose of Table 3 in the article?,"['To list the mitigation strategies for SS7/Diameter attacks', 'To compare the coverage of mitigation strategies in GSMA documents vs. common SS7/Diameter attacks', 'To provide a synopsis of industrial standards that address practical mitigation', 'To outline LTE interconnect security measures']",1,T-TUT-PROTO-2019-PDF-E.pdf
49,"• Person B is issued a new prepaid SIM card by the network operator  which has Person A 's  phone number (that 's the recycle action) .  • Person B can now access Person A 's DFS account and use whatever funds remained in person  A's account.     8  https://mwnation.com/be -alert-mobil e-money -fraudsters -on-the-loose/      TR-SS7-DFS  (2019)  13 14 Mitigation strategies for mobile operators   The SS7 attack surface is the domain of the mobile operator, global telecom organizations such as ITU  and GSMA have noticed the problem and issued guidelines for mobile operators to mitigate these  attacks, these guidelines are covered in several documents. The GSMA RIFS sub -group authored a  range of SS7 and diameter signa lling security related documents in response to the attacks described  above, which tackle different aspects of the signal ling security problem. Those documents are GSMA  internal and easily accessible to members only, therefore, n o exact reference is given and companies  that are members of GSMA have access to those documents available  in the GSMA internal tool at :  https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/gsmad ocuments/technical -documents/ . Clauses 14 -1 to 14 -4 provide a synopsis  on  what industrial standards exist and describe at a general level how they address  practical mitigation.     14.1 FS.11: SS7 interconnect security monitoring guidelines   This document describes how to monitor SS7 traffic for potential attacks. The first step in improving  signa lling related security is to evaluate what state the network is in. The main question is, is it under  attack, how hard, what kind of attacks. In this docu ment, mobile operators can find strategies on how  to effectively monitor traffic, how long  and how to classify incoming MAP messages that are arriving  on the interconnection interface. It lists mitigation strategies for many SS7 attacks on 2G/3G network.  Based on the filtering rules found in this document , an operator can determine if a message that arrives  at the interconnection interface is legitimate, prohibited, unauthorized, suspicious or otherwise  ""strange "".  14.2 FS.07 SS7 and SIGTRAN network security   This document provides substantial background how to handle SS7 messages on the edge of the  network. It describes the whole SS7 stack, while putting emphasis on the MAP protocol level, where  attacks are most common. I t provides security analysis for SS7 and SIGTRAN. It lists a set of  countermeasures for many SS7 attacks, and recommendations on how they can be deployed. FS.07  also contains details on how to configure an SS7 firewall or an edge node to stop unauthorized  messages and attacks from reaching the core network, for all MAP v2/3 messages and provides  countermeasures for the currently known SS7 attacks.   14.3 IR.82 security SS7 implementation on SS7 network guidelines   This document outlines general security measur es for SS7 security, which include , for example , SMS  specific security measures and many SS7 stack related security measures.
