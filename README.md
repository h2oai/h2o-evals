## Mission üöÄ
To showcase 25 Eval datasets for a range of different industries and types of evaluation for beginners, intermediates as well as experts.



<!-- ## H2O.ai LLM eval Datasets 

H2O Evals is a collection of Large Language Model datasets for a range of different industries and types of evaluation. The evaluation datasets were generated based on a set of documents within each of the different domains. The datasets have been prepared in a way so they can be used to evaluation both LLM and RAG systems. For each evaluation set, metadata is also attached to let you know the documents used. The format of these datasets allow automatic ingestion to H2O Eval Studio to run your own evaluation. 

These datasets were generated using LLM DataStudio which can also be utilized to help you develop your own evaluation datasets.   -->


## H2O.ai LLM Evaluation Datasets 

The evaluation datasets in this collection are for a range of different evaluation types: 

- **Conditional Questions** : The complexity of the question is increased by incorporating a scenario or condition that affects the context of the question.
- **Multi-hop Reasoning Questions** : The complexity of the question is increased, where the question should require the reader to make multiple logical connections or inferences using the information available in given context.
- **Token Presence** : Extract the minimum tokens necessary for accurate answers for the question.

The datasets in this project are generated based on documents for different industries, for example:

- Banking
- Risk Management
- Telecom
- Government
- Legal
- Health
- Finance
- Security
