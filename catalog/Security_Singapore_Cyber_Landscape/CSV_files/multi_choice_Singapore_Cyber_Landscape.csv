"Like in a long game of chess, threat actors are always seeking new ways to overcome defences, which means cybersecurity defenders around the world must constantly remain on our toes. True to form, the cyber threat landscape intensified in 2022. This was fuelled by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the opportunistic exploits of cybercriminals as COVID-19 restrictions began to ease. Disconcerting developments over the past year included bespoke exploits aimed at industrial Operational Technology (OT) systems, ransomware groups targeting essential organisations, and global service disruptions caused by hacktivist groups, among others. As Winston Churchill once said, however,  “The pessimist sees the difficulty in FOREWORD every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” While there were undoubtedly numerous persistent and emergent cyber threats that arose in the past year, there were also opportunities for Singapore to work with like-minded cyber organisations around the world to strengthen our collective digital resilience.  This duality is best typified by the ransomware  threat. Ransomware groups hit a new milestone in 2021 in terms of cyber-physical impact. They caused widespread disruption, leading to supermarkets closing, petrol stations running out of fuel, and healthcare services being delayed, all as a result of compromised systems. In 2022, they outdid this by disrupting an entire government’s services – the ransomware attacks on Costa Rica crippled around 30 critical services including utilities and healthcare systems. This resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency by the government. The audacity and severity of these attacks underscored the urgent need for coordinated efforts among governments to address the ransomware threat.  This is exemplified by the Counter- Ransomware Initiative (CRI), a global coalition aimed at collectively addressing the ransomware threat. Led by the US, the CRI aims to prevent cryptocurrency use in ransomware payments, share information, develop guidelines, and build cyber capacity. Singapore is fully involved in this initiative. We are co-leads of the countering illicit finance working group, committed to disrupting the financial flows, particularly in cryptocurrency, to ransomware operators.  Given the cross-border nature of this menace, collaboration within the CRI represents a key means to deprive ransomware groups of their lifeblood, creating a more hostile environment for them, and breaking their business models. This is also reflected in our local approach.  While the country has been fortunate to avoid the worst of these attacks, we established the Counter-Ransomware Task Force (CRTF) in 2022, reflecting our determination to combat this growing menace. Chaired by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), the CRTF brings together the expertise and resources of various government agencies, including the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Singapore Police Force (SPF), with support from the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC). The Russia-Ukraine conflict serves as  another striking example of local agencies banding together to confront cybersecurity risks resulting from an unstable geopolitical landscape. Now well past its 15 th month, the  conflict has greatly complicated the global cybersecurity environment, with a surge of hacktivist attacks on both sides and the discovery of highly destructive malware. One of the most worrying developments is the increase of malicious programs targeting industrial systems, posing a significant threat to vital services that sustain our daily lives and capable of causing unprecedented harm. These attacks have already caused significant disruption to Ukrainian systems. The potential of their spread beyond the conflict zone is a catastrophic possibility. As a small state whose security and existence  depends on the international rule of law, Singapore can be adversely affected by geopolitical instability and the potential for spill-over effects in cyberspace.

Additionally, Singapore’s Cyber Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) provided regular advisories to non-CIIs, alerting organisations of cybersecurity risks and recommended protective measures. Away from geopolitical cybersecurity  developments, scams continued to plague the local landscape. In 2022,  Singaporeans and organisations lost a total of around S$661 million to scams, a 4.5% increase over 2021. Singapore is combatting the scam menace across multiple fronts. Under the leadership of the SPF’s Anti-Scam Command (ASCom), over 16,700 bank accounts implicated in scams were successfully frozen, resulting in the recovery of approximately S$146 million for the victims. Additionally, the co-location of officers from six leading banks at ASCom has greatly improved the coordination of investigations. In order to bolster defences against scams, the IMDA has implemented solutions to flag out suspicious SMSes, while the MAS and the Association of Banks in Singapore introduced further measures to counter scams. These measures include the removal of clickable links in emails or SMS messages, as well as the implementation of an emergency self-service “kill-switch” for digital banking. The CSA has played a crucial role in supporting these collective endeavours. By investigating thousands of suspicious phishing URLs, the CSA has contributed to the detection and prevention of scams. In collaboration with the SPF, the CSA has also prioritised public awareness by regularly issuing alerts and advisories, educating the public about the latest scam campaigns and techniques.  The impact of cybercrimes such as scams  is typically measured in financial loss, but the emotional toll it takes on individuals - such as anguish, confusion, and distress - is immeasurable. In this issue of SCL, we offer perspectives from individuals who have fallen victim to ransomware incidents and insights from an incident responder to provide first-hand experiences of the impact of cybercrime, prevention measures, and response strategies. I found these real accounts enlightening, and hope readers will find them helpful in your cybersecurity journey. To further align with this focus on the impact on individuals and organisations, the government has adjusted its reporting methods for key malicious cyber activities to emphasise their impact on Singaporeans and what measures are being taken to address them. The old adage of ‘prevention is often better  than cure’ still rings true for cybersecurity. With the rapid pace of digitalisation, it is more important than ever for the public and organisations to assess their cybersecurity posture and adopt good Internet security practices.

Encouragingly, about 2,300 of these have shown improvement in their Internet hygiene after following the recommendations provided. By encouraging more organisations to follow suit, we can improve the overall cyber resilience of our ecosystems and ultimately make Singapore cyberspace more secure.

In this chapter, we take a closer look at three trends that dominated headlines over the past year: cyber threats targeting Operational Technology (OT) systems, the continued evolution of the ransomware threat, and the cybersecurity implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 10  SINGAPORE CYBER LANDSCAPE 2022 SINGAPORE CYBER LANDSCAPE 2022   11Ever since the computer worm Stuxnet  disabled Iran’s Internet-disconnected Natanz nuclear facility in 2010, threat actors have been researching and refining similar methods to strike targets. Like Stuxnet, these focus on altering the behaviour of Operational Technology (OT) systems used to manage industrial operations, to effect complete or partial shutdown of important facilities and equipment. By doing so, the malware could have caused harm to human lives, physical damage, and financial loss. Given the high potential for disruption and destruction, they are widely regarded as national security concerns. As we shall see, such threats have come a long way in the 13 years since Stuxnet first crossed the theoretical barrier that divided our cyber and physical worlds.    Background: What are OT Systems? OT systems are designed to interact with machines and are found in a diverse array of automated and industrial applications, from Figure 1: Graphical representation of an “air-gapped” system which is used in many OT environments. Such systems  are not directly connected to the internet. Data can only be passed to it physically (e.g. via USB or removable media with another machine). 1 Incontroller or Pipedream A malware package (or attack toolkit) of custom-made tools  targeting OT systems and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) devices that can scan, compromise and control affected devices once they have established initial access to the OT environment. It was discovered by researchers in April 2022, as it was being readied for use against US Critical Infrastructure (CI). Incontroller was specifically developed by threat actors to disrupt industrial processes and has been described by researchers as a “Swiss Army knife” for cyber-attacks against OT systems. It incorporates an expansive array of modules that can disrupt or prevent operators from accessing devices, permanently disable them, or leverage them to access other parts of the network. Such malware may also include wiper capabilities as just one among many functionalities within their arsenal. What sets Incontroller apart from other OT systems malware is its adaptability and multi-functionality, which could pose a threat to almost all types of industrial systems around the world. Fortunately, the malware was discovered before it could be used, and mitigation measures were quickly  implemented to protect vulnerable systems.   Cyber Threats Targeting OT  Systems: Evolution of Carnage factories to power plants, many of which are  involved in the provision of essential services. For this reason, such systems are almost always found in protected environments, and managed and monitored separately from Internet-facing IT systems.  In addition, given the criticality of the  infrastructure they control, OT systems are usually isolated or “air-gapped” from IT networks, running in separate and siloed environments away from the Internet (See Figure 1).

Like Stuxnet, these focus on altering the behaviour of Operational Technology (OT) systems used to manage industrial operations, to effect complete or partial shutdown of important facilities and equipment. By doing so, the malware could have caused harm to human lives, physical damage, and financial loss. Given the high potential for disruption and destruction, they are widely regarded as national security concerns. As we shall see, such threats have come a long way in the 13 years since Stuxnet first crossed the theoretical barrier that divided our cyber and physical worlds.    Background: What are OT Systems? OT systems are designed to interact with machines and are found in a diverse array of automated and industrial applications, from Figure 1: Graphical representation of an “air-gapped” system which is used in many OT environments. Such systems  are not directly connected to the internet. Data can only be passed to it physically (e.g. via USB or removable media with another machine). 1 Incontroller or Pipedream A malware package (or attack toolkit) of custom-made tools  targeting OT systems and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) devices that can scan, compromise and control affected devices once they have established initial access to the OT environment. It was discovered by researchers in April 2022, as it was being readied for use against US Critical Infrastructure (CI). Incontroller was specifically developed by threat actors to disrupt industrial processes and has been described by researchers as a “Swiss Army knife” for cyber-attacks against OT systems. It incorporates an expansive array of modules that can disrupt or prevent operators from accessing devices, permanently disable them, or leverage them to access other parts of the network. Such malware may also include wiper capabilities as just one among many functionalities within their arsenal. What sets Incontroller apart from other OT systems malware is its adaptability and multi-functionality, which could pose a threat to almost all types of industrial systems around the world. Fortunately, the malware was discovered before it could be used, and mitigation measures were quickly  implemented to protect vulnerable systems.   Cyber Threats Targeting OT  Systems: Evolution of Carnage factories to power plants, many of which are  involved in the provision of essential services. For this reason, such systems are almost always found in protected environments, and managed and monitored separately from Internet-facing IT systems.  In addition, given the criticality of the  infrastructure they control, OT systems are usually isolated or “air-gapped” from IT networks, running in separate and siloed environments away from the Internet (See Figure 1). In theory, while this made it extremely challenging for cyber-attacks to affect OT systems, threat actors have succeeded in crossing the “air gap” with highly customised and sophisticated malware",How does Incontroller malware differ from other OT systems malware?,"['Incontroller is designed to target both OT and IT systems.', 'Incontroller is specifically developed to disrupt industrial processes.', 'Incontroller can only be used against US Critical Infrastructure.', 'Incontroller has wiper capabilities.']",1,Singapore_Cyber_Landscape.pdf

The malwar e was extremely stealthy and was uncovered because the hackers made a mistake and triggered the safety  system leading to a shutdown of the plant. This prevented the release of toxic gases or explosions, which could have put lives at the plant and its surrounding areas at risk.Major cyber-attacks against OT systems  over the past 13 years include:KEY INCIDENTS Stuxnet A multi-stage computer worm specifically designed to cross the gap  to target programmable OT systems by several manufacturers and cause them to malfunction, while providing a false picture of normalcy to system monitors. Stuxnet was used to target Iran’s Natanz nuclear-enrichment facility in 2010, causing affected centrifuges to behave erratically, resulting ultimately in equipment failure and shutdown.  Triton Triton is regarded as the first malware known to target Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS). These systems are responsible for the operational safety of equipment and ensuring the emergency stoppages of systems when necessary. Once deployed on a safety engineering workstation, the malware can exploit a zero-day vulnerability that enables attackers to execute   codes on safety controllers, which are usually the last lines of defence preventing dangerous industrial accidents. Triton was used against a Saudi Arabian petrochemical facility in 2017, with the likely intention of causing a major accident. 2Industroyer  A malware deployed in the 2016 attacks on Ukraine’s electrical grid. This malware targeted several OT systems to orchestrate a massive outage across the country, disabling protective relay devices that cut off power to ignition systems. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a Ukrainian energy provider was targeted by a modified and enhanced version of the Industroyer malware, which tried to disable its electrical substations.

This allows the attacker to understand the target’s security posture, including how the OT and IT networks interface with each other, and to identify the “air gaps”. By properly researching the target, attackers can identify potential points of entry into those networks.  In the second stage, threat actors ‘engage’  with their target to achieve intrusion into the latter’s network. In the case of an OT environment, threat actors can accomplish this via removable media and devices (e.g. USB sticks, cables), through unsecured links between an organisation’s IT -OT systems, or through an IIoT interface.  Thereafter, in the third stage, threat actors can  employ different tactics to accomplish their objectives:   In the case of systems that can be con trolled remotely – such as SCADA  systems – this might mean gaining control of a management workstation, which can then be used to make changes on the target system, and/or hide valid alerts.  Alternatively, malware can directly tar get individual components to cause  malfunction.

"Organisations most affected comprised Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing and retail sectors. These figures, however, are not likely to represent the full extent of the ransomware threat as not every victim will report an attack. For instance, only 20% of US ransomware victims reached out to law enforcement for help, according to the FBI’s estimates. The continued proliferation of Ransomware- as-a-Service (RaaS) affiliate models means that anyone with the resources to buy such a service can launch a sophisticated ransomware attack, thereby substantially amplifying the ransomware threat.  In addition to their increasing audaciousness,  ransomware groups exhibited more commercial and professional-like behaviour in 2022, diversifying their portfolios to target Cloud environments and Linux systems, and adopting malware-free attacks. Their negotiation tactics became more aggressive, amidst falling ransomware revenue and concerted, coordinated global efforts to counter their nefarious operations. We take a closer look at several of these traits. Corporate Branding and   Customer-centricity Ransomware groups have evolved to become even more commercial and professional-like in 2022. They are now branding their ransomware and ransom notes with a distinctive logo and style as a form of brand identity. This could be an attempt by ransomware groups to cultivate a public profile, in order to reassure victims that they will regain access to their data once the ransoms are paid. Many groups now provide “customer support” functions to help victims through the ransom payment and file decryption processes, making their own remuneration process smoother and closer to a legitimate business transaction. Most offer the option of a small fee to extend the payment deadline and impose a penalty for missing the ransom payment deadline, not unlike how credit card companies offer the option of paying a minimum sum on your bill to avoid the late payment penalty on the full sum. A March 2022 report by Check Point Research  revealed the inner workings of the now defunct-Conti ransomware group, outlining a setup akin to a tech startup, with a structured hiring process, salaries, and bonuses. The image-conscious Conti subsequently shut down and rebranded itself as several smaller ransomware groups in mid-2022 following negative reactions arising from its conspicuous affiliation with Russia amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Former Conti members purportedly now operate the splinter Black Basta, BlackByte, Karakurt and Royal ransomware groups. Such groups will continue to evolve in tandem  with myriad geopolitical and economic developments. With ransomware revenue falling to US$456.8 million in 2022 from US$765.6 million the year before 8, ransomware  groups are now looking to seek out “new markets” just like what legitimate businesses would do. Cloud We Go and They Follow   (and Linux Next?) Increasingly, ransomware groups are turning their attention to cloud services and infrastructure as more organisations move their assets and data to the cloud. Check Point Research’s examination of the cloud-based networks landscape found that there was a significant 48% growth in cloud-based network attacks in 2022, particularly in Asia, which saw a 60% year-on-year growth. CrowdStrike’s 2023 Global Threat Report paints a starker picture: Observed cloud exploitation cases grew by 95% over the course of 2022, and cases involving cloud-conscious actors nearly tripled from 2021, albeit not all are ransomware groups.  Cloud services are interconnected, which  means compromising one system could enable the ransomware to spread rapidly to the many connected systems and organisations. Managed service providers for the cloud are thus prime targets for ransomware attacks because a single breach can impact many downstream customers. As cloud security is a shared responsibility between the vendors and customers, cloud-oriented ransomware attacks may sometimes occur due to misconfiguration or unpatched vulnerabilities on the customers’ end, because of confusion over each party’s cybersecurity obligations. For instance, the series of VMWare ESXi ransomware attacks in February 2023 which impacted over 3,800 servers had exploited a two-year-old vulnerability. This meant that the impacted customers were likely running out-of-date or unpatched versions of the VMWare ESXi software",What was the estimated revenue of ransomware groups in 2022?,"['US$456.8 million', 'US$765.6 million', 'US$1.2 million', 'US$5000000']",0,Singapore_Cyber_Landscape.pdf

Check Point Research’s examination of the cloud-based networks landscape found that there was a significant 48% growth in cloud-based network attacks in 2022, particularly in Asia, which saw a 60% year-on-year growth. CrowdStrike’s 2023 Global Threat Report paints a starker picture: Observed cloud exploitation cases grew by 95% over the course of 2022, and cases involving cloud-conscious actors nearly tripled from 2021, albeit not all are ransomware groups.  Cloud services are interconnected, which  means compromising one system could enable the ransomware to spread rapidly to the many connected systems and organisations. Managed service providers for the cloud are thus prime targets for ransomware attacks because a single breach can impact many downstream customers. As cloud security is a shared responsibility between the vendors and customers, cloud-oriented ransomware attacks may sometimes occur due to misconfiguration or unpatched vulnerabilities on the customers’ end, because of confusion over each party’s cybersecurity obligations. For instance, the series of VMWare ESXi ransomware attacks in February 2023 which impacted over 3,800 servers had exploited a two-year-old vulnerability. This meant that the impacted customers were likely running out-of-date or unpatched versions of the VMWare ESXi software",What is the reason behind ransomware groups' increasing audaciousness?,"['The falling ransomware revenue and concerted, coordinated global efforts to counter their nefarious operations.', 'The continued proliferation of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) affiliate models.', 'Their negotiation tactics became more aggressive.', 'The increasing number of cloud-based network attacks.']",1,Singapore_Cyber_Landscape.pdf

Check Point Research’s examination of the cloud-based networks landscape found that there was a significant 48% growth in cloud-based network attacks in 2022, particularly in Asia, which saw a 60% year-on-year growth. CrowdStrike’s 2023 Global Threat Report paints a starker picture: Observed cloud exploitation cases grew by 95% over the course of 2022, and cases involving cloud-conscious actors nearly tripled from 2021, albeit not all are ransomware groups.  Cloud services are interconnected, which  means compromising one system could enable the ransomware to spread rapidly to the many connected systems and organisations. Managed service providers for the cloud are thus prime targets for ransomware attacks because a single breach can impact many downstream customers. As cloud security is a shared responsibility between the vendors and customers, cloud-oriented ransomware attacks may sometimes occur due to misconfiguration or unpatched vulnerabilities on the customers’ end, because of confusion over each party’s cybersecurity obligations. For instance, the series of VMWare ESXi ransomware attacks in February 2023 which impacted over 3,800 servers had exploited a two-year-old vulnerability. This meant that the impacted customers were likely running out-of-date or unpatched versions of the VMWare ESXi software",What is the future outlook for ransomware groups?,"['They will continue to evolve and adapt to new technologies and security measures.', 'They will eventually disappear as law enforcement and cybersecurity measures become more effective.', 'They will shift their focus to other forms of cybercrime, such as phishing or malware attacks.', 'They will become more specialized and target specific industries or organizations.']",0,Singapore_Cyber_Landscape.pdf

The increase in cloud-oriented ransomware  attacks is just one manifestation of ransomware groups diversifying their portfolios in tandem with the evolving business environment. Trend Micro also observed ransomware groups such as BlackCat, Hive and RansomExx develop versions of their malware in the cross-platform language Rust, enabling them to customise their malware for both the Windows and Linux operating systems (OS) according to what their targets use. Rust is purportedly more difficult to analyse and has a lower detection rate by antivirus software, making it more appealing to ransomware groups.

Such extortion-only tactics are sometimes referred to as “data-kidnapping”.

Such findings were echoed in Cybereason’s research, which underscored that only 42% of organisations that paid the ransom managed to restore all their systems and data. 54% still encountered system errors and corrupted data after decryption using keys provided by the attackers. Nearly 80% of organisations that paid the ransom were hit by a second ransomware attack, 48% of which was perpetrated by the same attackers, and 68% demanding a higher ransom.

"For instance, in February 2023, the BlackCat ransomware group leaked several personally intrusive photos of cancer patients receiving radiation treatment at the Leigh Valley Health Network, when the latter refused to pay its US$1.5 million ransom. In February 2023, the Medusa  ransomware group likewise released a 51-minute-long video showcasing sensitive data stolen from Minneapolis Public Schools, when the school district refused to pay its US$1 million ransom. The video purportedly included student sexual violence allegations, student discipline records, civil rights investigations, student maltreatment cases, and sex offender notifications. Both Leigh Valley Health Network and  Minneapolis Public Schools refused to pay the ransom. However, many organisations did so in other ransomware attacks, often with an unexpected negative outcome.

Role of Big Tech  The conflict has also been characterised by the unprecedented involvement of “Big Tech” companies.  The impact of Big Tech is highly visible in our  everyday lives. They supply technology and platforms used daily by billions of individuals and organisations around the world. However, in the arena of geopolitics – traditionally the domain of nation states – Big Tech has often opted to remain in the background, avoiding the need to pick sides to minimise losses to its bottom line.  This was not the case in the Russia-Ukraine  conflict. Over the past year, many Big Tech companies have publicly and actively taken sides, demonstrating their support for Ukraine in various ways. Many, including Google, IBM and Microsoft, announced the suspension of some or all of their business activities in Russia at the start of the conflict. Social media platforms blocked access to Russian state media from their sites. Facebook and Instagram removed Russian state media from their platforms in Europe, whereas Google dropped Kremlin content from Google News.  Some Big Tech companies went a step further,  providing tactical support to Ukraine on the physical and cyber battlefields. In the early days of the conflict, Microsoft reportedly worked with the Ukrainian government to transfer important digital operations and data to the cloud within 10 weeks. They also provided cybersecurity services to protect Ukrainian critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks. Google supported Ukraine’s efforts to protect civilians on the ground when they disabled some live features on their Maps applications in Ukraine to protect the safety of local communities, and introduced a rapid Air Raid Alerts system for Android phones in Ukraine, at the request of, and with the help of the Ukrainian government.  The impact of these moves has not been  insignificant. In response to Meta’s move to restrict access to Russian media on their platforms, both Facebook and Instagram have been banned by Russia. According to reports, this could have cost Meta close to US$2 billion in revenue. Despite these potential revenue losses, Big Tech companies continue to play a key role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, demonstrating an unprecedented willingness to support a geopolitical cause – even if it comes at a short-term cost to their bottom line.  IMPLICA TIONS By deciding what capabilities to supply and to whom, Big Tech has demonstrated that they too can have an independent voice on the international stage, and can play a part in shaping geopolitical and wartime developments. However, this raises the question of who in these Big Tech companies makes these decisions – whether it is the CEO, the shareholders, or even the employees.

Role of Big Tech  The conflict has also been characterised by the unprecedented involvement of “Big Tech” companies.  The impact of Big Tech is highly visible in our  everyday lives. They supply technology and platforms used daily by billions of individuals and organisations around the world. However, in the arena of geopolitics – traditionally the domain of nation states – Big Tech has often opted to remain in the background, avoiding the need to pick sides to minimise losses to its bottom line.  This was not the case in the Russia-Ukraine  conflict. Over the past year, many Big Tech companies have publicly and actively taken sides, demonstrating their support for Ukraine in various ways. Many, including Google, IBM and Microsoft, announced the suspension of some or all of their business activities in Russia at the start of the conflict. Social media platforms blocked access to Russian state media from their sites. Facebook and Instagram removed Russian state media from their platforms in Europe, whereas Google dropped Kremlin content from Google News.  Some Big Tech companies went a step further,  providing tactical support to Ukraine on the physical and cyber battlefields. In the early days of the conflict, Microsoft reportedly worked with the Ukrainian government to transfer important digital operations and data to the cloud within 10 weeks. They also provided cybersecurity services to protect Ukrainian critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks. Google supported Ukraine’s efforts to protect civilians on the ground when they disabled some live features on their Maps applications in Ukraine to protect the safety of local communities, and introduced a rapid Air Raid Alerts system for Android phones in Ukraine, at the request of, and with the help of the Ukrainian government.  The impact of these moves has not been  insignificant. In response to Meta’s move to restrict access to Russian media on their platforms, both Facebook and Instagram have been banned by Russia. According to reports, this could have cost Meta close to US$2 billion in revenue. Despite these potential revenue losses, Big Tech companies continue to play a key role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, demonstrating an unprecedented willingness to support a geopolitical cause – even if it comes at a short-term cost to their bottom line.

KEY TRENDSWHA T DOES THIS MEAN? • As a result of CSA’s consistent outreach and engagemen t efforts, public awareness of  phishing threats is growing. More members of the public are actively reporting phishing cases to SingCERT . •  Nonetheless, the con tinued rise in phishing  cases, both in Singapore and worldwide, highlights the need for individuals and organisations to remain vigilant.WHA T CAN WE DO?• SingCERT in vestigates reported cases and reports malicious URLs to relevant parties for  takedown and/or blocking, and will publish an alert/advisory if a mass phishing campaign targeting Singapore is detected.  •  In 2022,  SingCERT facilitated the takedown of 2,918 malicious phishing sites, and published 98  alerts and advisories.  • Individuals and organisations can do y our part to keep our cyberspace safe by reporting  suspicious emails or websites via SingCERT’s incident reporting form.  • Number o f reported ransomware cases  remains high, with 132 cases in 2022 (a 4% drop from 137 cases in 2021), amidst a continued growth in ransomware cases observed globally.  •  Top tar gets: SMEs in Manufacturing and   Retail. • Ransom ware remains a major issue both in  Singapore and globally, with cybersecurity vendors reporting a 13% increase in ransomware incidents worldwide in 2022.  • The Gov ernment convened an inter-agency CRTF to develop recommendations that will   serve as a blueprint for Singapore to counter ransomware effectively (see pages 49 to 51 for more info).  •  Pre vention is key to avoid falling victim to ransomware. Organisations should take steps to  secure their systems and backup critical data regularly. • 13% decr ease in infected infrastructure in  Singapore, from 94,000 in 2021 to 81,500 in 2022, despite a sharp growth of infected infrastructure observed worldwide. •  Singapore ’s global share of infected  infrastructure fell from 0.84% in 2021 to 0.34% in 2022. •  Marks an impr ovement in cyber hygiene levels.  However, the absolute number of infected infrastructure in Singapore remains high. This is partly because Singapore is a data and digital cyber hub. •  The attack  surface will continue to grow, as  users continue to connect more smart devices to the Internet.

T ARGET .SG  This chapter presents the key trends and statistics of  malicious cyber activities observed in Singapore’s cyber landscape in 2022. Ransomware and phishing remained persistent threats locally, with more than one ransomware case reported every three days, and phishing attempts more than doubling over the past year.  In contrast, there was a decrease in web defacements and infected infrastructure, marking a general improvement in local cyber hygiene levels amidst the heightened threat landscape.
