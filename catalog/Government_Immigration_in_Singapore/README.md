# Sample Questions

#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the main theme of the paper discussed in the text?

**Answer:** The main theme of the paper is the history and current state of immigration policy in Singapore, with a focus on its economic, social, and political motivations.

**Token Presence:** ['history', 'current', 'state', 'immigration', 'policy', 'Singapore', 'economic', 'social', 'political']

#### Sample Multi choice questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the role of temporary foreign workers in Singapore's immigration policy?

**Answer:** ['To bring capabilities that are relatively scarce in the resident population.', 'To relieve labor force constraints across all parts of the skill distribution.', 'To accept work that Singaporean citizens prefer to avoid.', 'To moderate the impact of busts on resident employment through selective attrition of the foreign workforce.']

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What was the impact of the government's measures to tighten foreign worker policy on the growth of the non-resident workforce in Singapore?

**Answer:** The growth of the non-resident workforce in Singapore plateaued in the mid-2010s, rising from 1.044 million workers in 2009 to around 1.415 million in 2016, while assimilation into the resident workforce slowed down significantly.
