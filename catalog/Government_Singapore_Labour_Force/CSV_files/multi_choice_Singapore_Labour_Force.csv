"|02| Labour Force in Singapore 202 2 LABOUR FORCE IN SINGAPORE 2022     1. Introduction     1.1 The report on the Labour Force In Singapore draws on data from the Comprehensive Labour Force  Survey (CLFS).   Unlike the Monthly Labour Force Surveys, the CLFS is run annually with a larger sample,  longer survey duration, and measur es a wider range of labour market indicators.  Th e breadth and  depth of information from the CLFS enables  a comprehensive review on the performance of the  resident population, with key findings distilled in this annual report .  In this year’s report, we  highlight   the continued recovery of the resident labour force from the impact of the pandemic and assess  the  patterns of improvement in relation to longer -term structural trends.  The report also includes insights  on own account workers and training from the Labour Force Supplementary Surveys.       2. Labour Force     Employment rate further increased in 2022    2.1 After a sharp rise in 2021, the employment rate for residents aged 15 & over continued to increase  to 67.5% in 2022, 2.3% -points above the pre -COVID rate in 2019.  The sustained increase was due  to more unemployed residents finding employment, as  the unemployment situation  improved to pre - COVID levels.     Chart 1  Employment rate of residents aged 15 and over     Per Cent        2.2 When ranked against Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) countries,  Singapore’s employment rate ranked high, in third place.  Singapore ranks second for male  employment rate (behind Iceland) and fourth for female employment rate (behind Iceland, Sweden,   and New Zealand).  Although the female employment rates of  Sweden and New Zealand were higher  than Singapore, their male employment rates were  lower.

While the employment rate has improved over the year for  both women (75.1% to 76.2%) and men (88.9% to 89.6%) in this age group, women saw a larger increase in their employment rate over the longer term.  The increased involvement of women in the  workforce  reflects their rising educational profile as well as efforts to promote more progressive  gender attitudes and facilitative workplace practices (e.g. flexi ble-work arrangement).        |04| Labour Force in Singapore 202 2 2.4 While the employment rate of seniors aged 65 & over in 2022 (31.0%) has ea sed from 2021 (31.7%)  following a surge in the previous year, it still rose on average between 2019 and 2022 (+1.1% -points  per year), higher than the average annual increase in the earlier period (+0.9% -points per year  between 2012 and 2019).  Building on sustained efforts to raise the employability of seniors, the  progressive increase in re -employment ages will help more older workers who wish to continue  working remain at work.     2.5 Employment rate of youths (aged 15- 24) fell from a two -decade high of 37.2% in 2021 to 34.5% in  2022, with fewer students taking on part -time or temporary work .

The increase is a co ntinuation of its longer -term upward trajectory, alongside improvements in the  educational profile of the workforce.  On the other hand, the share of workers in production & related  positions dipped, though the pace ( -0.4% -points) eased from 2021 ( -1.5% -points) and was on par  with the average decline before the pandemic ( -0.4% -points per year).

Even in recessionary years,  permanent employees formed around nine in ten of all resident employees.  With the economic  recovery and tight labour market, there was a smaller proportion of workers  in non- permanent  employment in 2022.  The share of resident employees on fixed -term contracts (7.4%) and in  casual/on- call work (3.1%) declined back to pre -COVID levels.

"Chart 20  Resident regular own account workers   Number (‘000)              4  The number of regular own account workers rose for the fourth  consecutive year, but the rate of increase was smaller than the previous year.   5  The estimate is derived based on the number of regular primary own account workers, as a proportion of total resident employment (average over 12 months  ending the middle of the year).     Labour Force in Singapore 2022  |21| 2.23 Around one in ten regular own account workers were in  full-time employee jobs in June 2022.  This  likelihood of switching out of own account work  for those who did own account work by choice  was  higher in 2022 and 2021 when the labour market was comparatively tighter than earlier years.  This  suggests that notwithstanding the motivati ons for own account work, a higher share would move to  full-time employee jobs if there were opportunities to do so.  Those  who did not prefer own account  work  and found full -time employee jobs fell in 2022 but was nonetheless higher than pre -COVID  years.

There was an  uptick in those who utilised onli ne matching platforms (from 33% in 2021), as demand for point -to- point transport o r delivery services continued to rise.      Chart 22 Resident regular own account workers who used online matching platforms   Per Cent            6  In the absence of internationally agreed statistical definition, online matching platforms are defined as labour sharing plat forms that serve as intermediaries to  match or connect buyers with workers who take up piecemeal or assignment -based work.  Such platforms could be either websites or mobile applications,  covering services such as ride -hailing, goods/food delivery, creative work, etc.     Labour Force in Singapore 2022  |23| Private -hire car drivers, taxi drivers and delivery workers remained top occupations of  primary own account workers     2.25 The top jobs held by own account workers also reflect the underlying trend toward more digitally  intermediated work and higher demand for transport and delivery services.  Private -hire car drivers  remained the most common occupation among regular primary o wn account workers in 2022.  The  number of private -hire car drivers increased in 2022 as demand for point -to-point transport services  increased when more employees commute to work.

Training     3.1 In 2022,  almost one in two residents in the labour force participated in job- related structured training,  broadly similar to the last two years.

This was likely due to more time spent on easing back to the workplace as businesses resumed to pre - COVID no rmality, lending less time to training.  The re- opening of borders and entertainment venues  may also entice individuals, when not at work, to go for leisure activities than training.     3.4 Amongst non- trainees, fewer indicated that they  did not consider the nee d for training and/or are  already satisfied with their current skills and knowledge, suggesting more  are recognising the need  for lifelong learning.  Work and family responsibilities remain the  other  top reasons for not attending  training .12     3.5 Training enables jobseekers to acquire relevant work experience, skills , and networks to boost their  employability and continues to be vital in upskilling mid- career switchers.  While the training  participation rate of the unemployed has eased in 2022, thi s decline came on the back of a high  reached in 2021 when the resurgence in hiring could have spurred more of the unemployed to  undertake training to move into new jobs.

As a result, the share of employees with a tenure of less than one year  was largely unchanged from 2021 at around 18%.     4.5 Most employees have a longer job tenure, suggesting that they settle into their careers after more  frequent job changes early in their working lives.  About half of all employee s have been in their job  for at least five years, including a rising proportion with  a job tenure of ten  years or more.   The increase  in the share of longer -tenured employees was observed for those in their 30s and over.   The underlying  uptrend in longer -tenured employees reflects the continued relevance of our resident workforce in  the labour market, supported by skills and educational upgrading as well as policies such as the  Retirement and Re -employment Act to keep older workers employable.

Similar to last year, the overall decline was driven by the falling  hours of full -timers who formed a large majority of emp loyed residents.  This outweighed the slight  increase in hours among part -timers as consumer- facing sectors such as Food & Beverage Services  and  Retail Trade,  which have a higher reliance on part -time workers,  experienced a pick -up in business  when COVID -19 domestic restrictions eased significantly.
