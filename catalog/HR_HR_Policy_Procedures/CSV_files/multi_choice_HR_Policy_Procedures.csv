Policies and Procedures Template - Page 5 SECTION 2 General Policies Decent Work Decent work means more than fair wages and beneﬁts. It reﬂects a cultural shift that builds on the values that drive your work in your community. Decent workplaces are fair, stable and productive workplaces. Decent work means building a culture of equality and inclusion at work, and ensuring everyone’s voices are valued and heard. Decent work means acknowledging the highly gendered nature of the nonproﬁt sector’s workforce – and developing solutions that address women’s particular interests and concerns. Through adopting decent work practices, your organization will be better able to meet your mission and contribute to thriving communities. And in doing so, you help build a stronger, more resilient nonproﬁt sector. The above text is used with permission of the Ontario Non-Proﬁt Network.

It is therefore essential the people involved with the Foundation, board members, employees and volunteers demonstrate their ongoing commitment to the core values of integrity, honesty, impartiality, openness, respect, and responsibility.

"Third party opinions with respect to contracts or grants applications will be kept conﬁdential. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 8 Procedures: 1. All employees, volunteers and contractors must sign the Foundation conﬁdentiality agreement during orientation. 2. Two copies of the conﬁdentiality agreement will be made. A copy will go to the person signing the agreement and the second copy will be ﬁled and a scanned copy is saved on the server. Conﬂict of Interest When a conﬂict of interest occurs, it can erode public and internal trust, damage the Foundation’s reputation, potentially hurt the organization ﬁnancially and, in some cases, break the law. While one may think conﬂict of interest applies only to people serving on the Foundation’s board, it really can occur at any level within an organization, including part-time employees and contractors. Foundations can replace their own Conﬂict of Interest policy and procedures with the text below. Foundations should check with legal counsel to ensure their text is enforceable in their province. Policy and Procedure Statement A Foundation must strive, as far as possible, to conduct its aﬀairs in an honest, forthright, and impartial manner. It is not enough that those making decisions believe that they are operating from the highest motives, and that any particular action is innocent. So far as possible, actions and relationships must avoid any appearance of impropriety that may raise questions in the minds of the public. The Foundation recognizes that employees will be associated with organizations that, from time to time, may apply for funding. This policy is directed towards the sources of most potential conﬂict which include conﬂicts arising as a result of aﬃliation with: ● an organization or individual which has, or is negotiating, a business relationship with Foundation, ● an organization seeking funding or other support from the Foundation. Deﬁnitions: Conﬂict of interest (as it applies to an “Individual”) means an actual, apparent or potential conﬂict of interest in the exercise of unbiased judgment on behalf of the Foundation and its dealings with any person, who may be obligated to the Foundation or may beneﬁt from dealings with the Foundation. For the purpose of this deﬁnition: “Individual” means any oﬃcer, director, employee, contractor or volunteer who is working for or on behalf of the Foundation and includes members of the Individual’s immediate family including, without limitation, the individual’s common law spouse. “Person” means an individual person, corporation or body corporate, partnership, organization, or any other recognizable group or association that purports to deal with the Foundation. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 9 Procedure: A conﬂict of interest on the part of an employee, volunteer or contractor of the Foundation will be disclosed. When any such interest becomes a matter of Board or Committee action, such individuals shall declare the conﬂict and absent themselves from the discussion. The minutes of all actions taken related to the matter will clearly reﬂect that these requirements have been met. Reporting Violations Policy and Procedure Statement It is each employee’s, volunteer’s and contractor’s personal responsibility to bring violations or suspected violations of the Foundation’s Code of Ethics to the attention of the ED/CEO. The Foundation’s policy prohibits any retribution against employees, volunteers or contractors who come forward to make such reports. Whenever practical, all reports or allegations will be thoroughly investigated by the ED/CEO prior to judgments being made or action being taken in response to suspected violations. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 10 SECTION 3 Employment Information (this section only applies to employees) Hours of Work Policy and Procedure Statement Foundations should refer to their provincial employment standards legislation for this section.

Policies and Procedures Template - Page 18 Insurance for Employee or Volunteer Use of Own Auto Most foundations are not in a position to own or lease vehicles, which means employees are using their own vehicles for foundation business. The purpose of this policy is to outline the employee’s and the Foundation’s insurance coverage when an employee uses their own vehicle for Foundation business. In this instance the Foundation’s insurance coverage must include non-owned auto. The policy also applies to volunteers using their automobile on Foundation business. The Foundation’s non-owned auto coverage limit needs to be substituted for the limits in the policy below. The Foundation also needs to get conﬁrmation from their employee or volunteer that they are suitably insured. Policy and Procedure Statement When an employee or volunteer is using a personal vehicle while on Foundation business, their personal auto insurance is the primary insurer. The Foundation’s limit for non-owned automobiles is $2 million. This is paid in excess of the underlying automobile insurance for the owner of said vehicle. For example, if the employee has an underlying liability limit of $1 million (as is typical) and uses a personal vehicle for Foundation purposes and a claim is substantiated in the amount of $2.5 million, the owner’s automobile policy would pick up the ﬁrst $1 million and the Foundation’s insurance would pick up the additional $1.5 million.

Full-Time & Part-Time Employees: Salary, beneﬁts and vacation will be conﬁrmed at time of employment and reviewed annually. ED/CEO: Salary, beneﬁts and vacation will be as negotiated through an employment contract and reviewed annually. Some Foundations provide additional beneﬁts to their employees, such as group insurance, RRSPs or parking. Participating in existing group medical coverage is more cost eﬀective.

"Appendix A provides links to provincial ESAs. Policy and Procedure Statement It is the policy of the Foundation to comply with the Employment Standards Code, and the Foundation reserves the right to change its policy without notice if there is a change in such law. Due to the complexities of family and medical leaves, it is important to contact the ED/CEO regarding speciﬁc leave requirement requests. Requests for leave are accepted for the following periods of unpaid leave: Emergency Leave: An employee may receive up to ten days of leave to attend to family emergencies. This leave will be unpaid, but will not aﬀect seniority, beneﬁts or the employee’s position. This leave will comply with the Employment Standards Act. The ten days do not have to be taken consecutively. The employee must inform their employer as soon as possible if they will need to take any of these days oﬀ. The employer has the right to ask for proof of the emergency. Personal Leave: A personal leave may be granted on a limited basis depending on business needs. This leave will be unpaid. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code. If an intermittent or reduced leave is Policies and Procedures Template - Page 23 requested on this basis, the Foundation may require the employee to temporarily transfer to an alternative position with equivalent pay and beneﬁts which better accommodate the intermittent or leave schedule. Medical/Disability Leave: An employee may be granted a medical leave because of a serious health condition or non-work-related injury due to an accident. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code. As a condition of the employee returning from a leave because of the employee’s own serious health condition, the Foundation may require medical certiﬁcation from his/her health care provider that the employee is able to resume work. This leave may be paid or unpaid according to the short-term disability policy provisions for the Foundation. Pregnancy/Parental Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code. Parental Leave for Birth and Adopting Parents: As per the Employment Standards Code. Family Responsibility Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code. Bereavement Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code. Compassionate Care Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code. Bereavement Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code. Jury Duty: As per the Employment Standards Code. Reservists’ Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code. Sick Leave Sick days reduce turnover. Studies have shown that companies that oﬀer paid sick leave see a reduction in employee turnover somewhere between 3.61% to 6.43%. Low turnover maintains consistent productivity, boosts employee engagement and morale, and builds a sense of unity between staﬀ and managers. Foundations are encouraged to include this policy within their document as it provides clarity for handling employee absence due to illness. The following policy can form the basis of one developed for your Foundation. Policy and Procedure Statement This policy applies to bona ﬁde non-occupational illnesses and injuries. The accumulation of sick leave time allows continuation of full base pay plus beneﬁts when an eligible employee is required to be absent from work because of non-occupational illnesses, injuries or medical conditions. Sick leave is accrued based on a staﬀ member’s regularly scheduled hours of work. A full-time employee accrues sick leave at the rate of ten days each calendar year. A regular part time employee accrues sick leave on a pro-rata basis. Sick leave may not be carried over into a subsequent calendar year and it cannot be cashed out as it has no intrinsic cash value. Sick leave balances are not earned compensation nor are they payable at termination of employment. Sick leave is paid on a straight time basis not to exceed the scheduled hours for the scheduled work hours missed. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 24 Sick leave will not accrue for any period during which an employee is absent from work for more than ten workdays, except for absence due to holidays, vacation and personal days and approved Employment Standard Act leaves. When an eligible employee will be oﬀ on Sick leave, he/she must notify his/her supervisor as soon as he/she knows that he/she will be unable to work, but no later than the starting time of the employee’s work day. Employees must notify their supervisor on each day of absence unless other arrangements have been made",What is the policy of the Foundation regarding compliance with the Employment Standards Code?,"['The Foundation must comply with the Employment Standards Code and can change its policy without notice if there is a change in the law.', 'The Foundation is not required to comply with the Employment Standards Code and can change its policy at any time.', 'The Foundation must comply with the Employment Standards Code but cannot change its policy without notice even if there is a change in the law.', 'The Foundation can choose to comply with the Employment Standards Code and can change its policy without notice if there is a change in the law.']",0,HR_Policy_Procedures.pdf

"When an eligible employee will be oﬀ on Sick leave, he/she must notify his/her supervisor as soon as he/she knows that he/she will be unable to work, but no later than the starting time of the employee’s work day. Employees must notify their supervisor on each day of absence unless other arrangements have been made. When an eligible salaried employee has been out on sick leave for more than three (3) consecutive scheduled work days, he/she is required to submit documentation from a health care provider to their supervisor certifying the medical necessity for the absence and expected date of return to work. Sick leave may be used for illness of the eligible employee or for illness of a member of his/her household (up to three (3) days per calendar year). Sick leave is provided for the reasons stated in this policy and may not be used for other purposes. Sick leave pay may not be advanced. In cases of illness, which is expected to continue beyond sick leave accrual, the Short-Term Disability Beneﬁt (if applicable) and/or Family or Personal Leave provisions of applicable provincial legislation will apply. Regular full-time employees earn sick leave from the ﬁrst full payroll period worked. Paid sick leave may not be taken in advance of accrual. However, employees are allowed 10 ‘personal emergency leave’ days under the Employment Standards Act. These may be taken at any time once an employee begins work (i.e. regardless of probationary period). However, they do not need to be paid. Sick Leave must be recorded as such on payroll time sheets so that accurate records can be maintained. All information about an employee’s medical condition is conﬁdential and must be kept by the ED/CEO in a ﬁle separate from the employee’s personnel ﬁle. When an employee is absent for medical reasons, the employee’s regular personnel ﬁle will contain only the dates of the medical absence, not the medical reason(s) for the absence. The Foundation reserves the right to have an employee visit an alternate physician, participate in an Independent Medical Examination (IME) or to make other appropriate investigations in cases of protracted illness or frequent absences.

Employee, Volunteer and Contractors’ Obligations Maintaining a safe work environment requires the continuous cooperation of all employees, volunteers and contractors. ● They must recognize that it is their duty to comply with all Health and Safety rules, regulations and guidelines","What are the obligations of employees, volunteers and contractors in maintaining a safe work environment?","['Employees, volunteers and contractors are obligated to report any unsafe conditions to their supervisor.', 'Employees, volunteers and contractors are obligated to follow all health and safety rules and regulations.', 'Employees, volunteers and contractors are obligated to provide proper training to new employees.', 'Employees, volunteers and contractors are obligated to maintain a clean and organized workspace.']",1,HR_Policy_Procedures.pdf
"When an eligible employee will be oﬀ on Sick leave, he/she must notify his/her supervisor as soon as he/she knows that he/she will be unable to work, but no later than the starting time of the employee’s work day. Employees must notify their supervisor on each day of absence unless other arrangements have been made. When an eligible salaried employee has been out on sick leave for more than three (3) consecutive scheduled work days, he/she is required to submit documentation from a health care provider to their supervisor certifying the medical necessity for the absence and expected date of return to work. Sick leave may be used for illness of the eligible employee or for illness of a member of his/her household (up to three (3) days per calendar year). Sick leave is provided for the reasons stated in this policy and may not be used for other purposes. Sick leave pay may not be advanced. In cases of illness, which is expected to continue beyond sick leave accrual, the Short-Term Disability Beneﬁt (if applicable) and/or Family or Personal Leave provisions of applicable provincial legislation will apply. Regular full-time employees earn sick leave from the ﬁrst full payroll period worked. Paid sick leave may not be taken in advance of accrual. However, employees are allowed 10 ‘personal emergency leave’ days under the Employment Standards Act. These may be taken at any time once an employee begins work (i.e. regardless of probationary period). However, they do not need to be paid. Sick Leave must be recorded as such on payroll time sheets so that accurate records can be maintained. All information about an employee’s medical condition is conﬁdential and must be kept by the ED/CEO in a ﬁle separate from the employee’s personnel ﬁle. When an employee is absent for medical reasons, the employee’s regular personnel ﬁle will contain only the dates of the medical absence, not the medical reason(s) for the absence. The Foundation reserves the right to have an employee visit an alternate physician, participate in an Independent Medical Examination (IME) or to make other appropriate investigations in cases of protracted illness or frequent absences. Time Oﬀ For Medical Appointments Employees are requested to make appointments at times that will minimize time away from work. Conditions of taking time oﬀ will be at the discretion of the supervisor. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 25 SECTION 5 Health and Safety Health and Safety Canadian health and safety legislation requires employers to have a health and safety program in their workplace. A written policy helps to promote an eﬀect program. Such policy should reﬂect the special needs of the workplace and should be regularly reviewed and updated. Foundation’s should refer to their provincial Occupational Health and Safety regulations when developing this policy, links to which can be found in Appendix A. Policy and Procedure Statement The Foundation acknowledges it has a duty under the current Occupational Health & Safety Legislation (insert appropriate name of provincial legislation) and Federal Labour Standards to take all reasonable precautions to protect all persons working on site, (employee, volunteers, board members, donors) and all visitors. Fire exits are located throughout the premises. For everyone’s own safety, all persons should be familiar with the locations of these exits and the most eﬃcient route to exit in case of ﬁre. The Foundation will maintain all Statutory Health and Safety practices and implement such others as are consistent with the needs and position as a charitable organization. All persons when on site are required to refrain from any activity which may jeopardize the health and safety of others. Employee, Volunteer and Contractors’ Rights There are three basic rights for employees, volunteers and contractors under the joint responsibility health and safety model: ● The right to know about workplace safety hazards, ● The right to refuse unsafe work if they have “reasonable cause to believe the work is dangerous”, ● The right to participate in the occupational health and safety process.

However, employees may consume alcohol if they so choose under the following guidelines: A. Employees are expected to make travel arrangements at functions where they are representing the Foundation and at which they are consuming alcohol, such as: assign a designated driver, take alternate transportation, arrange to stay in a hotel B. An employee may be asked to stop consuming alcohol if it is believed they are exhibiting inappropriate behaviour. Any employee found to be in violation of the preceding paragraph will be subject to disciplinary action which may include termination of employment.

FOundations need to reﬂect on each of the statements to ensure that they comply with their values, principles and practices that are acceptable in their community. Policy and Procedure Statement All Foundation employees are required to: A. Come to work ﬁt for duty B. Take reasonable care to protect the health and safety of themselves and others at all times C. Refrain from being impaired by alcohol, marijuana and any other drugs while on duty D. Notify their supervisor if they suspect that a co-worker is unﬁt for duty E. Consume intoxicants in a responsible manner at all times when at Foundation events and other functions where employees represent the Foundation. The Foundation will help and encourage employees who recognize a problem by referring them to treatment facilities. Employees who would like additional information regarding this matter should contact the ED/CEO. All such inquiries will be treated with the utmost conﬁdence. Use of Illegal drugs: ● The use, sale, purchase or possession of illegal drugs while on the job or Foundation property is strictly prohibited. ● Employees may not report to work under the inﬂuence of illegal drugs. ● Employees are required to immediately notify the ED/CEO of any suspected instance of use, possession, or knowledge of someone under the inﬂuence of such substances on Foundation property. In addition, any employees of the Foundation convicted of any drug-related crime must notify the ED/CEO within ﬁve days of any such conviction. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 27 Use of Alcohol: The Foundation does not provide funds for the purchase of alcohol at Foundation sponsored activities. However, employees may consume alcohol if they so choose under the following guidelines: A. Employees are expected to make travel arrangements at functions where they are representing the Foundation and at which they are consuming alcohol, such as: assign a designated driver, take alternate transportation, arrange to stay in a hotel B. An employee may be asked to stop consuming alcohol if it is believed they are exhibiting inappropriate behaviour. Any employee found to be in violation of the preceding paragraph will be subject to disciplinary action which may include termination of employment. Policies and Procedures Template - Page 28 SECTION 6 Hiring Hiring Process Being open and clear with candidates helps to set proper expectations, avoid disappointments, and shape a positive candidate experience. By being transparent, your Foundation will not only have an easier time recruiting top talent, you will also have higher rates of retention because expectations have been clear from the beginning. Given that the Foundation beneﬁts the community, it is important in the hiring practices, to ensure that the workplace reﬂects their community and to authentically grow a commitment to gender equity as an organization. This policy provides guidelines that will help to mitigate risk in all aspects of the hiring process. Use this as a guideline when developing your Foundation’s process and amend to ﬁt your practices.
