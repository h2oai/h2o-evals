Geneva, January 2009    3           Introduction    Hari Bucur-Marcu    In historical terms, defence management emerged as a topic of interest for the de-fence sector not too long ago. It is no more than five decades since some Western na-tions introduced the concept of managing defenc e in addressing such issues as allo- cating financial or human resources, solving strategic or operational problems in a comprehensive approach, or using business- like tools governing the defence sector.  Such an enterprise requires excellence at all levels and in every department of the defence establishment. One proven way of ac hieving this is to apply the managerial  functions of planning, organising, leading and controlling to those segments and activi- ties of the defence organisation that may contribute to maximising the operational  performance of armed forces.  The problems in need of managerial solutions are similar throughout the entire  Euro-Atlantic space, regardless of the stat us of each individual nation, be it a North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member or a partner. Some of these problems are decades old but became urgent in the last fifteen years or so. Among these prob-lems, the cuts in personnel and spendings as a result of the ‘peace dividends’ after the  end of the Cold war, as well as the increased demands for more deployable forces that operate far away from their home bases and have to be sustained for longer periods.   To consider the application of managerial approaches to these and other similar  problems, they should emerge in the general  context of democratic concerns on the  status of defence and enquiries related to outputs and outcomes of the defence sector in general, and the defence forces in particular.  This is a pre-condition of great impor- tance, since it is very unlikely that any organisation financed with public money, in- cluding defence organisations, would ever initia te their own measures to increase effi- ciency, unless there are incentives or pre ssure exercised from above. If this observa- tion is accepted, then any theoretical  approach to defence management should be an- chored in the realm of democratic cont rol over defence and the armed forces. Hari Bucur-Marcu 4  Defining Defence Management  There is no universally agreed definition of ‘defence management,’ but it simply en- capsulates the idea that defence organisations  need to turn defence policies into prac- tice, and in doing so, to develop appropriate and sustainable planning mechanisms, support systems and infrastructure.  More than half a century ago, defence was identified as a public good produced by  a democratic government on behalf of the people. About the same time, the scientific world discovered that governments are by t heir very nature inefficient producers of  public goods. The question then became how t he governments can provide defence in  a more efficient manner, and part of the answer was to introduce managerial practices to defence. In turn, management may be described as the science or the coherent way an organisation is acting in order to meet it s objectives in given conditions, in an effec- tive and efficient manner, by adequately perfo rming the functions of planning, organ- ising, leading and controlling.  The modernisation of the defence sector is another central challenge governments  in the Euro-Atlantic community have been fa cing for at least a decade. Some nations  are concentrating on transforming their armed forces to better respond to the new se- curity challenges of the 21 st Century, while others are undertaking more ambitious  overhauls of the entire domain of defence under the goal of building new defence in-stitutions, especially the nations that rec ently transitioned from communist to democ- ratic regimes or that are still in the final phas es of this transition",What is the relationship between democratic control and defense management?,"['Democratic control is essential for defense management to function effectively.', 'Defense management operates independently of democratic control.', 'Democratic control and defense management have no direct relationship.', 'Democratic control is a hindrance to effective defense management.']",0,Defense_Management.pdf

All these states have  strategic expectations from security and defenc e sector reforms, rightfully considering  the success of these reforms as facilitating their integration in the Euro-Atlantic com-munity and enhancing their people’s security and prosperity.  The achievement of these strategic goals requires better distribution of constrained  public resources, a more efficient way of utilising these resources and a more visible and accountable outcome of governmental programmes, including defence pro-grammes. In more and more nations, the public administration is replacing its rather inflexible and highly bureaucratic form of working on behalf of the public with more flexible and accountable public sector management. The question then is how gov-ernments can ‘produce defence’ in a more e fficient manner. Part of the answer is seen  in the introduction of good managerial practices from the business sector into defence, where the achievement of expected results in a competitive environment is paramount for the survival of any organisation.

Part of this initia-tive deals directly with the concept of  defence management. One of the objectives  stated in the PAP-DIB document, namely objective five, calls for the nations embarking on building defence institutions to “devel op effective and transparent measures to op- timise the management of defence ministries and agencies with responsibility for de-fence matters, and associated force structures, including procedures to promote inter-agency co-operation,” while objective nine deals with the management of defence spending. 2  In a managerial sense, planning is differ ent from planning for military operations,  yet it still has a direct impact on force development or procurement of major military equipment. Managerial planning implies both focussing on the ultimate goals as stated in relevant policies and flexibility in achiev ing these goals. Also in a managerial sense,  organising implies bringing flexibility to rigi d structures by organising work processes  within these structures instead of re-organising the structures themselves. At its turn, leading implies both assuming responsibilities and delegating elements of the deci-sion-making process, which differs from the well established command chain in the armed forces. Controlling means mostly to keep track of developments and intervene whenever necessary to re-focus staff on objectives.  On the other hand, defence management does not and cannot substitute the spe- cific military processes of planning and c onducting military operations, or acquiring  combat readiness. What defence management can do is to join up people within the defence organisations with training for mi ssions, with equipment and support for better  accomplishment of the defence objectives and missions.  Where Defence Management Stands within the Defence Sector  As an institutional process, the management of defence is situated between defence policy formulation and actual command and cont rol of the military forces. It should ad- dress areas of action such as defence resource management, personnel manage-ment, acquisition management, where—during defence policy implementation—it is  likely that inherent uncertainties require  higher flexibility and subsequent decisions,  and unexpected problems might occur, requiring proper identification and appropriate solutions",What is the NATO-EAPC initiative in the field of partnership cooperation?,"['An initiative to promote inter-agency cooperation in defense management.', 'A programme to support defense institution building in partner countries.', 'An initiative to enhance transparency and accountability in defense spending.', 'A platform for NATO member countries to share their defense resources and expertise.']",1,Defense_Management.pdf

At the level of the defence sector proper, some institutional requirements should be  considered in order to grant a fair chanc e of success to any enterprise to introduce  managerial tools and practices.

In other words, a ministry of defence should adopt the same managerial philosophy as the general government, even if the domain of defence makes this min-istry distinct among all others in the government. This is important for ensuring an ap-propriate dialogue between policy makers at all levels of government and for facilitat-ing the flow of resources necessary for implementing the policies.

Is creating the appropriate conditions part of the defence management framework, or is it a component of another domain, such as defence institutionalisation or defence plan-ning? The obvious answer is that creating the appropriate conditions is not managerial  in nature, so long as management is dealing more with implementing policies and finding solutions rather than defining requirements.  At the level of the defence sector proper, some institutional requirements should be  considered in order to grant a fair chanc e of success to any enterprise to introduce  managerial tools and practices. Ministries of defence, if they want to be successful, have to meet two conditions when devel oping and introducing such managerial tools  and practices: they have to be part of the management framework of the general gov-ernment and they should provide an organisa tional structure separate from the de- fence staff. In other words, a ministry of defence should adopt the same managerial philosophy as the general government, even if the domain of defence makes this min-istry distinct among all others in the government. This is important for ensuring an ap-propriate dialogue between policy makers at all levels of government and for facilitat-ing the flow of resources necessary for implementing the policies. Looking around the  Euro-Atlantic community, we can find exampl es of governments that paid special at- tention to their ministries of defence in t he process of introducing different forms of  management, such as resource allocation based on programmes and multi-annual planning.   But there are also governments that kept their ministries of defence apart from the  trials and experiments that characteris ed the implementation phase of new manage- ment in public governance.

The experience of different nations shows that some glam- orous defence initiatives failed to deliver year s after their implementation. As a whole,  the record of delivery in key areas of defence remains inconsistent. Time and again, governments had to go back to first princi ples and develop new approaches to ensure  an appropriate level of efficiency of public spendings on defence. They had to put ac-tions on their agendas aimed to better clarify future directions of change, as well as  key underlying concepts of management to be embedded in defence.  Be it efficiency oriented or more problem solving oriented, defence management  requires certain conditions related to ex isting decision-making frameworks and imple-Hari Bucur-Marcu 8  mentation systems. Among these conditions we may name supervision, accountability,  inclusiveness, legitimacy, morality and many others. Whenever such conditions are not  met, actions should be taken in order to create them. Here we are facing a dilemma.

As for the separation between civilian and military leadership and their staffs, this  condition is of paramount importance if we consider management as being an organ- isational enhancer and not a substitute for well-established military command and control procedures. That is to say that management would be the primary responsibil-ity of civilian leaders, while military comm anders would maintain their current roles and  would not be transformed into managers. This separation is presented here for theo-retical purposes only. In reality, we may notice a blurred demarcation between civilian and military roles in defence management, especially at the strategic level. If the key Introduction 9  task of defence management were to steer the efforts of the defence organisation to- ward effective and efficient implementation of policy goals and objectives, then all matters other than the conduct of military operations would fall in the remit of defence management, whether in the realm of civilians or military.  The institutionalisation of defence management  bears the local specificity of every  nation or defence sector. Some nations  choose to establish defence management  boards or councils with dedicated missions and terms of reference, while other nations  make no institutional separation between organisational structures and management tasks. 3 In this section we look only at instit utionalisation requirements, or principles,  leaving the appropriate structures and functions aside.  The main institutional requirements for successfully managing a ministry of defence  comprise (certainly there are many more aspects that might be brought into the dis-cussion but they may not carry the same management specificity as these ones):   • Legality of all organisational and institutional measures  • Appropriate mechanisms and procedures for managerial decisions and for su- pervision  • Accountability regulations   • Inclusion of all participants in the implementation phases of managerial deci- sions.   Legality is one of the most important institutional conditions for any organisation,  and it preserves its importance for the defence organisations as well.

Such legislation should include provi- sions regulating organisational structures  and their managerial attributes.

As for the separation between civilian and military leadership and their staffs, this  condition is of paramount importance if we consider management as being an organ- isational enhancer and not a substitute for well-established military command and control procedures. That is to say that management would be the primary responsibil-ity of civilian leaders, while military comm anders would maintain their current roles and  would not be transformed into managers. This separation is presented here for theo-retical purposes only. In reality, we may notice a blurred demarcation between civilian and military roles in defence management, especially at the strategic level. If the key Introduction 9  task of defence management were to steer the efforts of the defence organisation to- ward effective and efficient implementation of policy goals and objectives, then all matters other than the conduct of military operations would fall in the remit of defence management, whether in the realm of civilians or military.  The institutionalisation of defence management  bears the local specificity of every  nation or defence sector. Some nations  choose to establish defence management  boards or councils with dedicated missions and terms of reference, while other nations  make no institutional separation between organisational structures and management tasks. 3 In this section we look only at instit utionalisation requirements, or principles,  leaving the appropriate structures and functions aside.  The main institutional requirements for successfully managing a ministry of defence  comprise (certainly there are many more aspects that might be brought into the dis-cussion but they may not carry the same management specificity as these ones):   • Legality of all organisational and institutional measures  • Appropriate mechanisms and procedures for managerial decisions and for su- pervision  • Accountability regulations   • Inclusion of all participants in the implementation phases of managerial deci- sions.   Legality is one of the most important institutional conditions for any organisation,  and it preserves its importance for the defence organisations as well. It is expected that the introduction of any managerial framework in the defence sector will be accom-panied or preceded by appropriate legislation.  Such legislation should include provi- sions regulating organisational structures  and their managerial attributes. Whenever                                                                           3 Just to give some examples, in the United Kingdom, there is the Defence Council chaired by  the Secretary of State and comprising the hi ghest-raking civilians and military officers, and  tasked to serve as the highest decision-making body for the conduct of defence affairs. Here,  defence management is in the remit of the Defence Management Board, chaired by the  Permanent Under Secretary and providing seni or-level leadership and strategic management  of Defence. The Board is comprised of the non-Ministerial members of the Defence Council  and external, independent non-executive members. In  the United States of America there is  just a Defence Management Council, mirroring an in ternal board of directors in a corporation  and comprising senior civilians and military in high positions in the Department of Defence. In  France, there are two committees at the level of  the Ministry of Defence: the Ministerial  Committee on Defence Investments, chaired by the Minister of Defence and tasked to ex- amine the operational requirements that must be satisfied, but also the financial and eco- nomic information relating to the most important  investments within the Ministry before they  are launched, and the Finance Committee,  which deals with budgetary issues",What is the importance of institutionalisation of defence management?,"['It ensures that military operations are conducted effectively and efficiently.', 'It enhances the organisational enhances the organisational capabilities of the defence sector.', 'It provides a framework for managerial decisions and supervision.', 'It allows for the separation of civilian and military roles in defence leadership.']",2,Defense_Management.pdf

Hari Bucur-Marcu 10  the public domain is involved, and especially in the security and defence sectors,  clear-cut legal provisions give a sense of protection against abuses and corruption but  also assign responsibility to both military and civilian leaders for their decisions and  actions.   Moreover, a legally established decision-making system would allow for flexibility in  policy implementation. Any effective mechanism of policy formulation and implementa-tion within the government, and in the defence sector in particular, would comprise a system of checks and balances to ensure both that the policy is consistent with the su-preme goals and interests of the nation, and that it is clearly understood and effectively implemented by the appropriate organisations. Nevertheless, the implementation phase is never linear. Some of the intentions might not be fully understood, others might not be realistic, and still others may become obsolete during implementation due to changing external or internal conditions.   In a fully bureaucratic and rigid system, any such instances would require reitera- tion of the policy formulation process and a referral to the decision-makers at most senior levels, which in practical terms often equates to not implementing the policy at all. In most if not all cases, such situations lead to serious waste of the scarce re-sources already invested in such failed policy implementation efforts. If the system permits, from a legal point of view, to ta ke corrective managerial actions in policy im- plementation, there would be no need to reiterate the process of policy formulation as long as the objectives remain the same. The managers would be responsible, in the name of the law, for reaching the objectives stated in the policy, while using their dis-cretionary powers to choose appropriate paths for implementing this policy. Also in le-gal terms, it is expected that all civil servant  positions at all levels of the organisational  hierarchy would have clearly stated managerial remits.   For effective and successful defence management, it is important that appropriate  decision-making and supervision mechanisms and procedures are fully institutional- ised. For defence purposes, the most important quality control systems are those measuring performance at the strategic level, namely matching policy goals and ob-jectives with concrete defence outcomes such as force structures and capabilities. But supervision mechanisms should be developed at all levels. For the operational level and, especially, for the current level, this in stitutionalisation implies remits of supervi- sion established in job descriptions and st andard operating procedures for civilian and  military personnel in executive positions, and these remits should be associated with  appropriate quality control mechanisms or syst ems developed at the appropriate level.   Institutionalisation of supervision mechani sms implies also introducing procedures  for the flows of information up and down in the defence organisation, as no real super-vision can be effective in the absence of appropriate knowledge about relevant as-Introduction 11  pects and achievements in policy implem entation.

Institutionalisation of supervision mechani sms implies also introducing procedures  for the flows of information up and down in the defence organisation, as no real super-vision can be effective in the absence of appropriate knowledge about relevant as-Introduction 11  pects and achievements in policy implem entation. These supervision mechanisms  should respond to questions such as:   • Is the policy fully understood by the military?  • How is the policy implemented?   • What are the results of the policy, once implemented?   The answers to these questions shoul d be obtained by employing appropriate  tools. One possible selection of such tool s comprises authorisation tools (approval of  implementation documents such as strategi es, doctrines, concepts or regulations; au- thorisation of funds within budget execution; endorsement of procedures, programme supervision and so on) and verification tools (theoretical models, simulations, trials,  evaluation exercises, inspections, surv eys and interviews, reviews and lessons  learned, auditing and others)",What are the different levels of supervision mechanisms that should be developed in the defence sector?,"['Strategic, operational, and tactical levels', 'Ministerial, executive, and operational levels', 'Policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation levels', 'Civilian, military, and joint levels']",1,Defense_Management.pdf

Such defence institutions  are effective, i.e., they are ‘getting  things done.’ They are also efficient, that is they are able to produce desired effects  without waste, minimising energy and costs. Transparency and accountability in the functioning of such defence institutions fo rm the ground for genuine civil oversight of  defence decision making and performance.  There are no more or less important among these facets of the modern defence  organisation. Each one is unique and absolutely necessary for getting maximum re-sults for minimum cost in defence. To some degree one could compensate the insuffi-ciencies in one or another of them but in the long-term, only a well developed and carefully maintained package of these characte ristics provides stable, effective and ef- ficient defence institutions capable of meet ing public expectations and contributing to  the consolidation of democratic institutions. Valeri Ratchev 16  The challenge to the modern defence institution at present is to provide a new bal- ance between the tasks of the armed forces and the means available in order to create affordable armed forces with sufficient room  for operations and capital investments. In  an era of ever more constrained resources and changing strategic requirements, there is a growing need to extract maximum benefit from the money spent on defence. And this is the mission of defence management",What is the main focus of the book discussed in the text?,"['Defence management and its role in ensuring efficient and effective defence institutions.', 'The importance of policy making, management, administration, command, and control in defence.', 'The impact of defence institutionalisation, democratic control, policy, and strategy on defence management.', 'The role of leadership in managing defence resources and achieving desired goals and objectives.']",0,Defense_Management.pdf

Such defence institutions  are effective, i.e., they are ‘getting  things done.’ They are also efficient, that is they are able to produce desired effects  without waste, minimising energy and costs. Transparency and accountability in the functioning of such defence institutions fo rm the ground for genuine civil oversight of  defence decision making and performance.  There are no more or less important among these facets of the modern defence  organisation. Each one is unique and absolutely necessary for getting maximum re-sults for minimum cost in defence. To some degree one could compensate the insuffi-ciencies in one or another of them but in the long-term, only a well developed and carefully maintained package of these characte ristics provides stable, effective and ef- ficient defence institutions capable of meet ing public expectations and contributing to  the consolidation of democratic institutions. Valeri Ratchev 16  The challenge to the modern defence institution at present is to provide a new bal- ance between the tasks of the armed forces and the means available in order to create affordable armed forces with sufficient room  for operations and capital investments.

In  an era of ever more constrained resources and changing strategic requirements, there is a growing need to extract maximum benefit from the money spent on defence. And this is the mission of defence management.  The requirements for effectiveness and efficiency are certainly not unique to de- fence organisations. Any business has to be e ffective and efficient in order to prosper,  or even to survive. And yet, defence organisations cannot be managed purely like  businesses. National defence has a comprehensive and in many cases vital role for a nation. It often has a strong impact on political, social, nation- and state-building de-velopments and is managed like a profit-oriented corporation.  Therefore, this chapter provides an ex planation of what is defence governance,  how it differentiates from management and command and what is the role of strategic leadership. On that basis, we identify the areas of defence institutions that could be strongly enhanced through adoption of modern business practices. As a result, the value of defence management is explained vis- à-vis traditional military bureaucratic or  command approaches.  The chapter does not preach a particular model of defence management. Instead,  it sets the context for detailed examinat ion of the key defence management issues in  following chapters. The themes and issues presented here are based on data and ob-servations in countries creating, reforming,  or transforming their defence institutions  and, without detailed elaboration, illustrate main points to be considered by those in-volved in arguing, planning, designing and im plementing defence institution-building  activities. Thus, it provides orientation to  policy makers who want to learn how a de- fence institution could be developed as an e ffective and democratic pillar of national  and international security, producing adequate defence at a socially acceptable cost.  Conceptual Orientation  A number of terms are used to explain how a defence institution is run – ‘government,’  ‘political directing,’ ‘governance,’ managemen t,’ ‘public administration,’ ‘strategic lead- ership,’ ‘command and control,’ etc. In everyday language and institutional documents, these terms are often seen as synonyms. Act ually, each of them represents a specific  conceptual view and approach applicable in the ov erall national context or the specific  context of a defence institution. Moreover, in the area of institution-building they are often perceived to be of a ‘Western’ origin (and concern) that have only recently rip-pled outward to other nations. Without simplification, they are relevant in a different manner to different political systems, state organisations and types of defence institu-Governance, Management, Command, Leadership: Setting the Context 17  tions. And they could be appropriate to de scribe a country’s historical development,  culture, economic and social maturity, and strategic environment.  The efforts to create, reform or transform a national defence institution require the  elaboration of a sufficiently coherent concept with adequate breadth and depth to pro-vide guidance for building an organisation, c apable of performing politically designated  roles and functions effectively and efficiently . The lessons learned from the experience  of other countries may be relevant but the political development of any single country  makes its defence institution a particular case. Furthermore, although most of the cen-tral issues in defence institution-buildi ng, development and transformation are generic,  and as such must be confronted in any democ racy, the differences from one country to  another “in history, security environment, and institutional structures can be so vast that the lessons learned in the older, more ‘mature’ democracies often are not fully relevant to new ones.” 1  Defence institutions could not be developed in  isolation from the country’s political,  administrative and cultural realities.

Democracy is about equality. We put the emphasis on liberal democratic government following the classi cal explanation by Alexis de Tocqueville  and others that liberalism is about freedom.

Peo-ple with authoritarian thinking perceive weakness when observing political processes and decision-making marked by transparency, debates and dissent, accountability and substantial public oversight and control. In fact, these are the underlying strengths of a  democracy. Key components of governmental power in democracy are the areas in which it keeps monopoly of authority. Depending on the maturity of democracy and the  development of the market economy, these may include, inter alia , monopoly of natu- ral resources, land, roads and foreign policy. The use of military power and deadly violence should always be only in the hands of the democratic government. Hence the  thesis that outside the state security sect or there should be no military, paramilitary,  police or intelligence organisations. All such organisations should be integrated into an overall political decision-making process mark ed by civil control in order to keep them  effective and under democratic rule.  The existence of an effective system of checks and balances is among the most  important characteristics of any democracy.  It is aimed to guarantee that political  power is sufficiently dispersed and decentra lised to avoid any possible monopolisation  and to keep the people in control of governance as much as possible. The use of checks and balances through separation of power s actually means more sharing of re- sponsibilities and obligations than real division.

Valeri Ratchev 20  From the classic to the modern representative (republican) government, the state  has been seen as a political society capable of establishing control through political  choice. It determines the central government as the principal provider of control and  regulations over the national (state) territory . In this capacity, the government has ca- pabilities to defend this territory and the national interests using military power (alone or together with other instruments) and to defend and promote national interests abroad (alone or with allies) in case they are threatened by another military force. The fact that the likelihood of modern democratic states finding themselves in a classic type of war has diminished in recent year s does not mean that this role no longer  matters nor that government (the executive) is the only centre with authority and re-sponsibility to determine and implement defence policy.  The wide use of the concept of ‘governance’  started only recently. Definitions of  governance abound. 6 In accordance with Paul Hirst, governance is generally perceived  as an alternative to the central (strong) ‘gover nment,’ i.e., to control by the state. He  outlines five versions of ‘governance’ in different political, international, business and  social arenas:  7  Corporate governance, which arises from  having large and influential companies  with highly dispersed shareholders on one side and an active professional manage- ment on the other, aims to provide transparency and accountability of the executive management and to prevent companies from becoming autocracies in an environment  where democracy is the primary source of legitimacy.  Public governance,  which arises from privatising traditional public administrative and  service functions, aims to introduce a new model of public services distinct from that of  public administration under hierarchical cont rol and direct accountability to politically  elected officials.  Social governance is arising ‘in silence’  as a new type of network-based governing  that includes actors such as labour unions, business associations, NGOs and local authority representatives aimed at new, centrally bargained social pacts.  International governance uses the concept  of ‘governance without government’ in  the fields of international relations and regimes. It is based on the widely recognised  fact that many global and international iss ues like global warming, international trade,  arms control, and international standards in many areas cannot be solved by nation  states alone. Internalisation of gover nance performed by inter-governmental agree- ments and powerful agencies like the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank, and the G8 ex panding private actions and ‘the retreat of                                                                           6 Joan Corkery, ed., Governance: Concepts and Applications  (Brussels: IIAS Working Group,  International Institute for Admi nistrative Studies, 1999), 368-371.  7 Paul Hirst, “Democracy and Governance,” in Debating Governance: Authority, Steering, and  Democracy , ed. Jon Pierre (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 13-35. Governance, Management, Command, Leadership: Setting the Context 21  state’ raises important questions about who controls these international supra-state  actors and how, and do they limit the power and the capacity of democracy.  Good governance  first gained ground in the area of economic and social develop- ment. Widely supported by western countries and promoted through the power of in-ternational agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as a set of economic and social-political conditi ons for their loans, ‘good governance’ is a  concept based on the understanding that it is not possible to have effective economic  management and a stable social environment without full application of democratic and market principles",What is the relationship between governance and democracy?,"['Governance is a form of control that replaces democracy.', 'Governance is a form of control that complements democracy.', 'Governance is a form of control that is separate from democracy.', 'Governance is a form of control that is opposed to democracy.']",1,Defense_Management.pdf
"Widely supported by western countries and promoted through the power of in-ternational agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as a set of economic and social-political conditi ons for their loans, ‘good governance’ is a  concept based on the understanding that it is not possible to have effective economic  management and a stable social environment without full application of democratic and market principles. The concept recognises the fact that development is not just the  creation of markets and the promotion of investments and firm macroeconomic poli-cies, but also that state and social instit utions, laws and regulations, human and citizen  values do matter. In this way, ‘good gover nance’ as a concept means an effective po- litical framework conductive to private ec onomic actions – stable regimes (not neces- sarily democratic), rule of law, efficient st ate administration and (real) civil society. As a  strategy, it is aimed at developing a version of liberal social architecture with clear  separation between limited state and, to the extent possible, self-regulating society and market economy. Defining the principles of ‘good governance’ is difficult and often  controversial yet there is a list of principles around which there might be wide agree-ment, even beyond liberal democracies. Such an agreement rests in part on the con-siderable work done by the United Nations Development Program on international law and human rights: 8  • Participation – all men and women should have a voice in decision making,  either directly or through legitimate in termediate institutions that represent  them. Such broad participation is built on freedom of association and speech, as well as on capacities to participate constructively.  • Consensus orientation – among diffe ring interests, good governance medi- ates these differences to achieve a broad consensus on what is in the best  interest of the group and, where possible, on policies and procedures.  • Strategic vision – leaders and the public have a broad and long-term perspec- tive on good governance and human development, along with a sense of what is needed for such development.

This accountability differs depending on the organisation and whether the decision is internal or external.  • Transparency – transparency is built on the free flow of information.

There is also an understanding of the historical, cultural and social complexities in which that perspective is grounded.                                                                           8 United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Governance and Sustainable Human  Development (1997). These principles with slight variations appear in many other UNDP  documents. See, for example, UNDP and Governance: Experiences and Lessons Learned ,  http://mirror.undp.org/magnet/docs/gov/Lessons1.htm.

This accountability differs depending on the organisation and whether the decision is internal or external.  • Transparency – transparency is built on the free flow of information. Proc- esses, institutions and information are directly accessible by those concerned, and sufficient information is available to understand and monitor their activity.   • Equity – all men and women have opportunities to improve or maintain their  wellbeing.  • Rule of Law – legal frameworks should be fair and enforced impartially,  particularly laws on human rights.  As mentioned previously, defence policy is formulated and implemented not only  by the defence organisation per se but also by a variety of other governmental sectors and societal actors. Respectively, the i ssue of governance may be examined at two  levels.  At the national level, governance relates to how other actors, such as state agen- cies, local administration, civil society organisations, businesses, and others may play  a role in the process of shaping and implementing defence policy decisions, in par-ticular when the decisions are on matters of public concern.  On the level of the defence institution, we can speak of organisational governance  or governance in the ‘organisational space","What is meant by ""equity"" in the context of ""good governance""?","['All men and women have opportunities to improve or maintain their well-being.', 'The fair and impartial enforcement of laws, particularly those regarding human rights.', 'The ability of state and social institutions, laws, and regulations to promote human and citizen values.', 'The promotion of investments and firm macroeconomic policies.']",0,Defense_Management.pdf
