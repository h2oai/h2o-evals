The 4Rs of information security, which are risk assessment, risk management, risk reduction, and risk recovery, are all important aspects of a CSIRT's work, as they help to identify and mitigate potential security threats. The National Cybersecurity Strategy also plays a role in the work of a CSIRT, as it outlines the government's plan for protecting critical infrastructure and information systems from cyber threats. Finally, the ISO/IEC 27001 standard provides a framework for implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS), which is an important tool for a CSIRT in managing and protecting information security. In contrast, a CERT's main responsibility is to provide emergency response services to organizations in the event of a cyber attack or other information security incident. While they may also be involved in risk assessment and management, their primary focus is on responding to and containing security incidents. Therefore, while a CSIRT and a CERT share some similarities, their roles and responsibilities are distinct and complementary."
