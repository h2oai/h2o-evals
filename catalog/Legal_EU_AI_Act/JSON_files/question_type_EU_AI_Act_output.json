The GDPR sets out the general principles and rules for the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, while the LED specifically regulates the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. Remote biometric identification systems, which use biometric data to identify individuals at a distance, are subject to the provisions of both regulations. The use of remote biometric identification systems for criminal investigations must comply with the requirements of the GDPR, including the need for a legal basis for the processing of personal data, the protection of sensitive data, and the rights of data subjects. The LED provides additional guidance on the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes, including the requirement that the processing be necessary and proportionate for the prevention or investigation of a specific criminal offence. The intersection of these regulations highlights the tension between the need to protect individual privacy and the need to use technology to enhance public safety and security."

Social scoring systems, as described in Amendment 40, evaluate or classify the trustworthiness of natural persons based on their social behavior in multiple contexts or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics. These systems may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups, violating the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. The prohibition on AI systems that categorize natural persons by assigning them to specific categories based on known or inferred sensitive or protected characteristics would prevent the use of such systems for social scoring purposes, as they would be considered a violation of human dignity and non-discrimination. Therefore, the prohibition proposed in Amendment 39 would address the concern of social scoring and its potential violation of the right to dignity and non-discrimination."

Biometric categorization, as defined by the GDPR, is the process of assigning natural persons to specific categories or inferring their characteristics and attributes based on their biometric or biometric-based data. Biometric categorization can be facilitated by both 'real-time' and 'post' remote biometric identification systems, as both systems can be used to identify and categorize individuals based on their biometric data. However, 'real-time' systems may be more commonly used in applications where immediate identification is necessary, such as border control or law enforcement, while 'post' systems may be used in applications where a delayed identification is acceptable, such as in forensic investigations."
