This module focuses primarily on the management of financial records in the public  sector, with a particular emphasis on records created by central government agencies.  It will also be relevant to local government agencies; and will have some relevance to semi-government and private sector organisations.   In many countries the tradition is that records managers do not become involved in  managing financial records; it is generally assumed that financial records management  is the responsibility of accountants.  However, accounting staff have rarely been introduced to records management principles and practices.  They know what information they require and why, but they seldom receive training on how it should be kept.  Therefore, the care of financial records often falls in the gap between the two professions.  This problem often extends through all financial management functions.  The situation has important consequences for the capacity of countries around the  world to manage public sector spending and to introduce measures to enhance accountability and transparency.  Records managers have an important role to play in the care of financial records; this module aims to help them understand the functions and tasks involved.  The module deliberately contains a large amount of material on financial  management.  There is considerable emphasis on the analysis of stakeholders (or users), on functions and processes and on information flows.

The module deliberately contains a large amount of material on financial  management.  There is considerable emphasis on the analysis of stakeholders (or users), on functions and processes and on information flows.  Financial records are examined in this context.  MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   2 There are two reasons for including a high level of financial information in this  module.  First, in many countries there is no easy way for records managers to obtain this information, and unless they can speak the language of accountants and auditors, they will not be able to make an effective contribution.  Second, financial systems are so complex that there is no way to teach records managers how to manage the records generated by these systems other than by equipping them to analyse the various components of financial systems and then to apply records management principles.   The module does not seek to cover records management principles in any depth, as  they are covered in detail in other modules.  However, it does address records issues that specifically affect financial records.  The following key terms used in the module are defined here, so that users are  familiar with them as they work through the lessons.  A more detailed glossary of financial terms is also included as an annex to this module.    Financial management:  The planning, controlling,  implementation and monitoring of fiscal policies and  activities, including the accounting and audit of  revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.  Records management : That area of general  administrative management concerned with achieving  economy and efficiency in the creation, maintenance, use and disposal of the records of an organisation  throughout their entire life cycle and in making the  information they contain available in support of the  business of that organisation.  Accountability:  The requirement to perform duties,  including financial and operational responsibilities, in a  manner that complies with legislation, policies, objectives and expected standards of conduct.  Financial records:  Records resulting from the conduct  of business and activities relating to financial  management.    Users of the module should bear in mind that financial management and records  management operate in a dynamic and changing environment.  The information provided in this module offers sound principles for the management of financial records, but specific management strategies will change over time and will differ from country to country.  The module addresses records care at an advanced level; those studying it should have  a solid grounding in and experience with records management.

MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   2 There are two reasons for including a high level of financial information in this  module.  First, in many countries there is no easy way for records managers to obtain this information, and unless they can speak the language of accountants and auditors, they will not be able to make an effective contribution.  Second, financial systems are so complex that there is no way to teach records managers how to manage the records generated by these systems other than by equipping them to analyse the various components of financial systems and then to apply records management principles.   The module does not seek to cover records management principles in any depth, as  they are covered in detail in other modules.  However, it does address records issues that specifically affect financial records.  The following key terms used in the module are defined here, so that users are  familiar with them as they work through the lessons.  A more detailed glossary of financial terms is also included as an annex to this module.    Financial management:  The planning, controlling,  implementation and monitoring of fiscal policies and  activities, including the accounting and audit of  revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.  Records management : That area of general  administrative management concerned with achieving  economy and efficiency in the creation, maintenance, use and disposal of the records of an organisation  throughout their entire life cycle and in making the  information they contain available in support of the  business of that organisation.  Accountability:  The requirement to perform duties,  including financial and operational responsibilities, in a  manner that complies with legislation, policies, objectives and expected standards of conduct.  Financial records:  Records resulting from the conduct  of business and activities relating to financial  management.    Users of the module should bear in mind that financial management and records  management operate in a dynamic and changing environment.  The information provided in this module offers sound principles for the management of financial records, but specific management strategies will change over time and will differ from country to country.  The module addresses records care at an advanced level; those studying it should have  a solid grounding in and experience with records management.  Students using this module should have worked through or be familiar with the issues discussed in the core and advanced modules in this study programme before beginning.

This includes time spent doing the reading and considering the study questions. At the end of each lesson there is a summary of the major points.  Sources for  additional information are provided in Lesson 7.  In addition to the various terms defined throughout the module and included in the master glossary to the MPSR study programme, this module includes a glossary of specific financial terms, added as an appendix to the end of the module.  Throughout each lesson, activities have been included to help you think about the  information provided.  Each activity is a ‘self-assessed’ project; there is no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ answer.  Rather, the activity is designed to encourage you to explore the ideas presented and relate them to the environment in which you are studying or working.  If you are studying these modules independently and are not part of a records or MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   5 archives management organisation, you should try to complete the activities with a  hypothetical situation if possible.  If the activity suggests writing something, you should keep this brief and to the point; this is not a marked or graded exercise and you should only spend as much time on the activity as you feel necessary to understand the information being taught.  You are encouraged to write down your answers for all of the activities and keep the answers together in a booklet or file; you may want to refer back to your answers as you work through this module or through other modules in this study programme.   Following the summary at the end of each lesson are a number of self-study  questions.  Note that these self-study questions are designed to help you review the material in this module.  They are not intended to be graded or marked exercises.  You should complete as many of the questions as you feel will help you to understand the concepts presented.  External assessments, such as assignments or exams, will be included separately when this module becomes part of a graded educational programme.  ADDITIONAL RESOURCES   This module assumes that you have access to a records office, records centre or archival institution and that you have some involvement with the management of financial records.  The various activities may ask you to draw on your own experiences and compare those with the information provided in the lessons.  If you do not have access to such facilities, you may need to develop a fictitious scenario for  your activities.  Alternately, you may wish to discuss this module with friends or  colleagues who work with records and archives so that you can discuss principles and concepts with them and compare your understanding with theirs.

"It embraces daily cash management as well as the formulation of short-, medium- and long-term financial objectives, policies and strategies in support of the organisation’s business.  Financial management also includes planning and controlling capital expenditure, managing assets, liaising with the treasury and making decisions related to funding and performance.  Good financial management is critical to the success of any organisation, whatever its  size and whether or not it is in the public, private or voluntary sector.  In the public sector, the rendering of accounts to public scrutiny is key to accountable government. Financial records are produced in every area of financial management.  If these records not are well managed, the financial management function suffers.  Therefore, financial records management and records management are closely intertwined.  Financial management makes an important contribution to government, particularly in  the areas of  • accountability  • efficiency  • ensuring resources are matched to objectives  • economic stability.  This lesson examines these four areas of financial management.  It then discusses  changing approaches to financial management, and it examines the relationship between financial management and records.  It concludes with a discussion of the senior management issues involved in financial records management and emphasises the importance of securing senior management support for the involvement of records managers in financial records care.  Accountability  Accountability is fundamental to good governance.  Accountability is the process that allows people to measure and verify the performance of government.  Financial accountability is a critical component of accountable government.  It involves MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   7 legislative control of the executive through budgets and accounts.  Weaknesses in  financial accountability are generally linked to weaknesses in public accounting, expenditure control, cash management, auditing and the management of financial records.  An enhanced level of control over financial management is vital for all governments to maintain their commitment to their citizens.  Ensuring Resources are Matched to Objectives  Financial management ensures that money is allocated in accordance with the government’s strategic priorities.  This is achieved by controlling the budget approved by the legislature and is reinforced by the publication of audited accounts of what was actually spent.  Efficiency  Public sector financial management has been the focus of increasing attention in recent years.  Reductions in public expenditure have pressured public authorities to maintain services with less money.  To achieve cuts, financial managers have had to improve their financial analysis as a basis for improving efficiency and value for money.  Traditionally, financial management in government has focused on controlling  expenditure; the main emphasis has been on keeping public spending down in order to minimise borrowing.  However, private sector financial management techniques have increasingly been imported into the public sector.  For example the National Audit Office may carry out ‘value for money’ audits, which look beyond whether the money was spent according to the government’s financial regulations to whether the public is getting an economic, efficient and effective service.  In other words, financial systems in government are changing from systems designed to keep the government from spending too much to systems that ensure the government makes the best use of resources.  Economic Stability  Every modern government needs to define an economic policy and then manage its economy according to that policy.  Much of a country’s economy depends upon the private sector, but it can also be influenced by the government’s fiscal policies, interest rates and regulatory environment.   Government itself is a major component of a nation’s economy.  Public sector  borrowing and expenditure have an impact on the stability of the overall economy.  Governments can improve their capacity to manage the economy by introducing reforms of the treasury, budget preparation and approval procedures.

CHANGING APPROACHES TO FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT   Records managers need to stay abreast of changing trends in financial management.   Changes to financial management processes will inevitably affect the information systems needed to support them and the records generated by them.  Each country will have different experiences with financial management, as the country’s own financial circumstances and political and cultural factors will create different requirements.  The most successful systems are those that have been tailored to meet specific country needs.   Various approaches to financial management have been designed and tested in recent  years.  The recent trend is to move the focus away from measuring inputs toward measuring outputs: that is, to focus less on how much money has been spent on what product and more on whether the work performed has been useful.  Public sector financial management is increasingly seen as a tool to enable management to discharge its responsibilities more efficiently and effectively.  These trends are revolutionising government accounting practices, standards and reporting systems.   For example, the changing perspective in financial management has led to changes in  the process of budgeting.  There are now several different methods of budgeting, including the following.  • Line item budgeting lists expenditures for the coming year according to objects of  expenditure, or ‘line’ items.  These budgets specify how much money a particular  agency is permitted to spend on personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, and so on.  • Performance budgeting divides proposed expenditures into activities and relates  the activity to cost.  This method allows the budget to be built on the basis of  anticipated workload rather than incrementally, as in traditional line-item budgeting.   • Programme budgeting focuses on budgetary choices among competing policies  and treats the different budget objectives as variable.  • Zero-based budgeting arrives at a budget by literally starting from scratch.  At the  national level, this would require answering such questions as ‘what if we did not  have an army?’ or ‘what if national insurance did not exist?’  This has not proved useful as an annual budget tool.  As governments develop more business-type functions and operate services on a  commercial basis, the public sector is adopting features of private sector accounting.  For example there is a move from cash accounting to accruals accounting. MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   9 • Cash accounting includes only the transactions that actually take place within the  period covered by the account.  • Accruals accounting reflects all the financial transactions proper to the period of  the account, regardless of whether the account has actually been paid during that  time.  Cash accounting is traditional in central government.  Under this system, receipts and  payments are recognised only when cash is received or paid.  The emphasis is on the objects and purposes for which funds have been received and paid out during a particular period.  Cash accounting is also used when the system lacks enough sophistication to implement accruals accounting and the benefits of changing methods do not justify the costs involved.  Accruals accounting recognises transactions when they occur, irrespective of when  cash is paid or received.  Transactions are recorded in the accounting record and reported in the financial statements of the period in which the service was received (expenditure) or rendered (revenue).  Financial statements prepared on an accrual basis indicate past transactions involving  payment and receipt of cash, as well as future obligations to pay and payments to be received in the future",What is the relationship between government and financial management?,"['Financial management is a tool for the government to manage its finances well and contribute to the overall stability of the nation.', 'Financial management is a tool for the private sector to manage its finances well and contribute to the overall stability of the nation.', 'Government and financial management are unrelated concepts.', 'Financial management is a tool for non-profit organizations to manage their finances well and contribute to the overall stability of the nation.']",0,Financial_Records_Management.pdf

CHANGING APPROACHES TO FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT   Records managers need to stay abreast of changing trends in financial management.   Changes to financial management processes will inevitably affect the information systems needed to support them and the records generated by them.  Each country will have different experiences with financial management, as the country’s own financial circumstances and political and cultural factors will create different requirements.  The most successful systems are those that have been tailored to meet specific country needs.   Various approaches to financial management have been designed and tested in recent  years.  The recent trend is to move the focus away from measuring inputs toward measuring outputs: that is, to focus less on how much money has been spent on what product and more on whether the work performed has been useful.  Public sector financial management is increasingly seen as a tool to enable management to discharge its responsibilities more efficiently and effectively.  These trends are revolutionising government accounting practices, standards and reporting systems.   For example, the changing perspective in financial management has led to changes in  the process of budgeting.  There are now several different methods of budgeting, including the following.  • Line item budgeting lists expenditures for the coming year according to objects of  expenditure, or ‘line’ items.  These budgets specify how much money a particular  agency is permitted to spend on personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, and so on.  • Performance budgeting divides proposed expenditures into activities and relates  the activity to cost.  This method allows the budget to be built on the basis of  anticipated workload rather than incrementally, as in traditional line-item budgeting.   • Programme budgeting focuses on budgetary choices among competing policies  and treats the different budget objectives as variable.  • Zero-based budgeting arrives at a budget by literally starting from scratch.  At the  national level, this would require answering such questions as ‘what if we did not  have an army?’ or ‘what if national insurance did not exist?’  This has not proved useful as an annual budget tool.  As governments develop more business-type functions and operate services on a  commercial basis, the public sector is adopting features of private sector accounting.  For example there is a move from cash accounting to accruals accounting. MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   9 • Cash accounting includes only the transactions that actually take place within the  period covered by the account.  • Accruals accounting reflects all the financial transactions proper to the period of  the account, regardless of whether the account has actually been paid during that  time.

Accountability and Control  Records management reinforces financial management controls and supports accountability.  The ability to establish who did what, when, why and how is a powerful means of deterring individuals from engaging in fraud or corruption, thus enforcing accountability.  Well-managed records provide an unbiased account of responsibility and liability.  Authentic, reliable records provide an unambiguous link between the authorisation to carry out a transaction, the particular individual concerned and the date.  Thus records can identify abuse, misuse and non-compliance with financial instructions.   Financial management also depends upon a system of internal controls that make it  possible to carry out business in an orderly and efficient manner, ensure adherence to management policies and safeguard assets.  The management of financial records is a critical component of this control system.  Where financial records are not controlled, their completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Records needed for reference, decision making and risk assessment can become difficult to access.  The senior official responsible for accounting, such as the Accountant General,  normally issues detailed regulations for the control of financial management systems.

Complete and accurate records must be available to prove that these controls are functioning properly and consistently.   In turn, these controls help to ensure that the records themselves retain their context,  structure and content.

Conversely, in some cases government officers have been inappropriately accused of embezzling funds simply because the documents authorising the expenditure could not be located.  Well-organised and well-managed records are essential to combat economic crime and protect the innocent.  A financial records management programme should enable the physical and logical  control of records and prevent unauthorised access, tampering, loss or destruction, whether intentional or accidental.  Records management should contribute a layer of security and reassurance that operations are functioning at the level required.  Taken together, records management, accounting and auditing provide the layers of  control that are essential to ensuring transparency, probity and integrity in financial management systems.

However, financial records also have unique features that require attention.   Financial record-keeping systems in government are so large and pervasive that  changes to the system will need support at a senior level.  Moreover, because financial management systems are subject to accounting and auditing standards and are under the close control and scrutiny of government financial officers, it is essential that records managers gain the support of senior managers and other stakeholders in order to provide an effective financial records management service.  It is the record managers’ job to understand how records management can contribute  to the organisation’s financial management objectives and to articulate the case for efficient records management in terms that senior management can understand.

Records managers must understand the basic principles involved with financial management in order to be credible when working with financial managers.

Where the ultimate sanction of prosecution is appropriate, lawyers will rely heavily upon records to provide the evidence.  However, records management controls are often missing in government financial  control systems.

However, these documents tend not to prescribe rules for the management of records.  At the same time, financial records are usually outside the jurisdiction of the organisation’s records manager.  As a result, this vital resource is not managed or controlled adequately.  Failure to manage records can lead to the build up of unwanted records, overcrowding and disorganisation.

Creating an enabling environment will enhance the success of records management  programmes.

The Need for Financial Records Management  Financial records tend to be excluded from the records management process.  Despite  the fact that financial records are covered under the broad legislation governing the management of government records and archives, financial records tend to be stored separately from other records and even excluded from the jurisdiction of the records manager.  In this situation, the volume of records may grow uncontrolled until is exceeds the space available to store it.  Then the systems to control and retrieve the records will break down.   The breakdown of financial systems are often related to the breakdown in records  management",Why are financial records often excluded from the records management process?,"['They are covered under separate legislation governing the management of government records and archives.', 'They are usually stored separately from other records.', 'They are not considered important for the records management process.', 'They are managed by a different department.']",1,Financial_Records_Management.pdf
"They also empower the audit body to obtain access to all financial records.   Other legislation enacted in support of government functions may also give rise to  financial records or specify conditions for their maintenance, use or disposal.  For example, pensions legislation imposes an obligation on departments to maintain records of contributions.  Revenue laws may indicate a time limit on the recovery of tax or duties, thereby establishing a minimum period for the retention of revenue files.  Subsidiary requirements such as accounting instructions and financial regulations are frequently promulgated under powers conferred by a main law, such as a finance act.  These subsidiary requirements lay down more detailed conditions and requirements for accounting and financial records, including their creation, filing, storage, production and disposal.  Financial Records and Computers  Financial records are increasingly created using computers.  Financial functions are usually among the first to be automated.  Most countries have automated payroll systems and many have automated budget and accounting systems.  In some countries the entire financial management function has been incorporated into a single automated integrated financial management system.  Financial records are often the first electronic records that records managers are likely to encounter.  With the increasing use of electronic technologies, record keeping is becoming  technically more complex.  Although the fundamental principles for keeping records in an electronic environment are more or less the same as in a paper environment, the skills required to manage them may be different.  Records professionals and information technology (IT) specialists need to co-operate closely.  This may require the creation of a specialised electronic records unit within the National Archives.  The unit will require specialised equipment and an enhanced set of professional capacities.  Computerisation has implications for audit evidence.  The principles relating to audit  evidence do not change because an audit is being carried out in a computer environment.  Computer records in the form of data on magnetic disks or optical disks still provide the auditor with audit assurance.  There are few precedents that address the admissibility of computer records in a court  of law.  Where computer evidence has been submitted in legal cases the courts have taken into account expert evidence on the effectiveness of the IT control environment before assessing the reliability of the computer data.

MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   16 SUMMARY   This lesson introduces the concept of financial management and explains its  importance to government for  • accountability  • ensuring resources are matched to objectives  • efficiency  • economic stability.  Approaches to financial management change over time, and their success depends  upon access to information.  Reliable information is ultimately derived from accurate and complete records.  It is not enough simply to change approaches to financial management systems without giving attention to information systems.  It is essential that records managers understand the functions and processes that the records document so that they can ensure that records systems remain appropriate and effective.  This lesson has discussed those changing approaches to financial management, and it has examined the relationship between financial management and records.   It has also considered the senior management issues involved in financial records  management, emphasising the importance of securing senior management support for the involvement of records managers in financial records care.  The issues examined include  • the volume, scope and complexity of financial records  • financial records and accountability  • regulatory requirements and financial records  • financial records and electronic technologies  • the need for financial records management.

MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   19 LESSON 2  STAKEHOLDERS   Records managers need to understand the roles and requirements of stakeholders in  financial management.  Government systems are large and complex, and the fact that the public sector is accountable to the people adds a layer of complexity that is reflected in the various roles, responsibilities and information needs of public servants.  A stakeholder can be defined as follows:  A stakeholder  is any person, group or organisation that  has a claim on the organisation’s attention, resources or  output, or is affected by that output.  Key stakeholders in public sector financial management include some or all of the  following: the public, the head of state, the legislature, the government itself and in particular the cabinet.  Ministers outside the cabinet, the civil service as a whole and separate departments are also stakeholders.

"In this situation, the volume of records may grow uncontrolled until is exceeds the space available to store it.  Then the systems to control and retrieve the records will break down.   The breakdown of financial systems are often related to the breakdown in records  management.  People rarely make the link between problems in financial management and inadequacies in the way records are managed, yet records are the source of all the information used in financial management systems.  If records become so disorganised that it is difficult or impossible to audit properly, the long-term effect will be that fraud or errors will not be detected or corrected.  When a system of financial management breaks down, the consequences are serious.   Typical symptoms include the following.  • Monitoring systems are inadequate and information is difficult to access.  • Votes ledgers are not kept properly, and an important tool for expenditure control  is lost.  • Accounts are not produced on time, rendering them of limited value for  expenditure control and monitoring.  • The audit process is ineffective.

"Each has its own rules for financial reporting on the projects it funds, and the recipient country will be expected to follow these rules.  The records this generates are often kept separately from the government’s other financial records, and their treatment may not be consistent with the government’s financial instructions.  This can fragment the financial management system, with information in several locations.  OPERATIONAL -LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS   While all public sector organisations create and maintain financial records, certain core institutions have key roles to play in the operation of financial systems and management of the records they generate.  The core agencies are described below.  Central Bank  The central bank is responsible for maintaining the country’s monetary policy, issuing bank notes, regulating and supporting the country’s principal systems for clearing and settling payments and acting as fiscal agent for federal government debt.   In countries where the civil service accounting system has deteriorated, policy makers  will rely on records of cash balances in the central bank.  They provide a crude but accurate picture of how much has been spent and how much money the government has received from taxation and other sources.  The records of the central bank are highly sensitive and are often managed entirely separately from other public sector financial records.   MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   23 Finance/Economic Planning Agencies  The ministry or department in charge of finance and economic planning plays a major  role in translating the political objectives of the government into financial policies and workable instructions to departments and budgetary units.  The finance ministry is responsible for overall management and control of public  expenditure, government debt, fiscal policy and long-term financial planning.  It is also responsible for deciding what resources are necessary and how to distribute the resources.  This brings the ministry close to the political sphere.  In countries that operate planned economy models of economic development, the ministry in charge of planning, such as a National Development Planning Commission, may also contribute to planning the preparation of the budget and its execution.  The finance ministry’s treasury function comprises two activities:  • setting policy  • physically handling funds.  For historical reasons, in many former British colonies the institution of the Treasury  was abolished and replaced with a Department (later Ministry) of Finance responsible for policy and an Accountant General’s Department responsible for the physical handling of funds.  In other countries that are part of the British administrative tradition, the Exchequer  system, as it is known, often continues to operate.  Responsibility for managing money is decentralised to ministries and departments, but they are ultimately are answerable to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  The Treasury brings together and co-ordinates the data which is produced by each individual produced by each individual ministry or department.  Each ministry must work within the confines of the appropriate government regulations and must produce accounts which, when submitted to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, provide data for the preparation of the final government published accounts.  Accountant General  Some countries operate a centralised system of accounting controlled by an Accountant General.  The Accountant General, as the government’s principal accounting officer and adviser on accounting policy, is responsible for regulating the receipt and disbursement of funds.  He or she is responsible for overseeing accounting policies and procedures and for introducing changes as appropriate.

OPERATIONAL -LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS   While all public sector organisations create and maintain financial records, certain core institutions have key roles to play in the operation of financial systems and management of the records they generate.  The core agencies are described below.  Central Bank  The central bank is responsible for maintaining the country’s monetary policy, issuing bank notes, regulating and supporting the country’s principal systems for clearing and settling payments and acting as fiscal agent for federal government debt.   In countries where the civil service accounting system has deteriorated, policy makers  will rely on records of cash balances in the central bank.  They provide a crude but accurate picture of how much has been spent and how much money the government has received from taxation and other sources.  The records of the central bank are highly sensitive and are often managed entirely separately from other public sector financial records.   MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS   23 Finance/Economic Planning Agencies  The ministry or department in charge of finance and economic planning plays a major  role in translating the political objectives of the government into financial policies and workable instructions to departments and budgetary units.  The finance ministry is responsible for overall management and control of public  expenditure, government debt, fiscal policy and long-term financial planning.  It is also responsible for deciding what resources are necessary and how to distribute the resources.  This brings the ministry close to the political sphere.  In countries that operate planned economy models of economic development, the ministry in charge of planning, such as a National Development Planning Commission, may also contribute to planning the preparation of the budget and its execution.  The finance ministry’s treasury function comprises two activities:  • setting policy  • physically handling funds.  For historical reasons, in many former British colonies the institution of the Treasury  was abolished and replaced with a Department (later Ministry) of Finance responsible for policy and an Accountant General’s Department responsible for the physical handling of funds.  In other countries that are part of the British administrative tradition, the Exchequer  system, as it is known, often continues to operate.  Responsibility for managing money is decentralised to ministries and departments, but they are ultimately are answerable to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  The Treasury brings together and co-ordinates the data which is produced by each individual produced by each individual ministry or department.  Each ministry must work within the confines of the appropriate government regulations and must produce accounts which, when submitted to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, provide data for the preparation of the final government published accounts.  Accountant General  Some countries operate a centralised system of accounting controlled by an Accountant General.  The Accountant General, as the government’s principal accounting officer and adviser on accounting policy, is responsible for regulating the receipt and disbursement of funds.  He or she is responsible for overseeing accounting policies and procedures and for introducing changes as appropriate.
