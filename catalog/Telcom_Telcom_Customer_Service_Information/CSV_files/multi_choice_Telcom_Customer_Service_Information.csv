Introduction   The following chapter is the result from a preliminary discussion  in January 8, 2010  with  Lage Eriksson Senior IT -Architect at TeliaSonera. In this discussion Lage  presents a common  problem in the Telecom industry and issues surrounding it.   Within the telecom industry there is a lot of close customer contact and customer sales repr e- sentatives are used to dealing with a large amount of customer complaints, support and sales  errands. Information becomes more and more important and it is imperative to use the info r- mation in a corre ct way and at the right time. But as the flow of information grows, it is also  very difficult to sort out what information is beneficial for the task at hand.   Customer care and sales can be improved in many ways, one of which is providing better i n- formation to the person conducting a certain task. By providing relevant information at the  right time efficiency, quality and customer rela tionship can  be improved. We believe that there  is room for improvement of the i nformation being provided by IT supp ort systems in a Telco   (Telephone Company). This problem cannot be solved only by evaluating what type of info r- mation is needed , how IT supports and handles the information must also be considered .   1.1. Background   We have both worked at TeliaSonera in the  past. Alexander is experienced in the field of Cu s- tomer service as a former employee of s econd -line support. Fredric has  worked with the Pla n- ning, product and efficiency department. W hen asked if he had any ideas for  a master thesis  Lage presented this co mmon problem within the tel ecom industry. Because of our studies in  Human computer interaction and past experiences in both Customer service and Telco  IT  structure we felt that this idea was a perfect match for us.   1.2. Current Situation   Recurring customer  contact is unique to the telecoms industry . The services offered are used  by the customer on a daily basis, information and data are constantly being exchanged b e- tween the customer and the Telco . A Telco  also has  high demands on service, changing your  operator is hardly any trouble and there are always lucrative offers from others. The amount  of information and data that exists in this business puts a high demand on your companies IT  resources.    1.2.1 Customer Service Representative   Alexander has worked in  the telecom industry and this was a very stressful and demanding  job. They  often deal with customers that have been waiting a long time in a queue and aren't  that friendly. They  always need to make sure that the customer is satisfied with your services  so the customer  doesn't  leave the company",What is the main problem discussed in the text?,"['The need to improve the efficiency and quality of customer service in the telecom industry.', 'The difficulty of sorting out beneficial information in the telecom industry.', 'The high demand for IT resources in the telecom industry.', 'The stress and demanding nature of customer service representative jobs in the telecom industry.']",1,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf

Customer care and sales can be improved in many ways, one of which is providing better i n- formation to the person conducting a certain task. By providing relevant information at the  right time efficiency, quality and customer rela tionship can  be improved. We believe that there  is room for improvement of the i nformation being provided by IT supp ort systems in a Telco   (Telephone Company). This problem cannot be solved only by evaluating what type of info r- mation is needed , how IT supports and handles the information must also be considered .   1.1.

Because of our studies in  Human computer interaction and past experiences in both Customer service and Telco  IT  structure we felt that this idea was a perfect match for us.   1.2. Current Situation   Recurring customer  contact is unique to the telecoms industry . The services offered are used  by the customer on a daily basis, information and data are constantly being exchanged b e- tween the customer and the Telco . A Telco  also has  high demands on service, changing your  operator is hardly any trouble and there are always lucrative offers from others. The amount  of information and data that exists in this business puts a high demand on your companies IT  resources.    1.2.1 Customer Service Representative   Alexander has worked in  the telecom industry and this was a very stressful and demanding  job.

"The amount  of information and data that exists in this business puts a high demand on your companies IT  resources.    1.2.1 Customer Service Representative   Alexander has worked in  the telecom industry and this was a very stressful and demanding  job. They  often deal with customers that have been waiting a long time in a queue and aren't  that friendly. They  always need to make sure that the customer is satisfied with your services  so the customer  doesn't  leave the company. At the same time they also have high demands on  work requ irements; many customer service units  require their employees to handle a certain  amount of calls each day. On top all of this they are also expected to sell new services and  offers to the customer. Needless to say any help that can be offered is pretty much needed.            9     1.2.2 IT   The majority of the larger Telco’s today has  a very complex and tightly coupled IT archite c- ture. Many small systems are in use in addition to old monolithic legacy system which has  served their purpose. Information stored and used from these IT support systems are widely  spread throughout the whole architecture. This easily creates an environment where inform a- tion is hard to reach  and errors occur.

It is expected to have the  right information in the right time at the right place with the right costs in order to support the  right decision. Data w arehousing has become an important strategy to integrate heterogeneous  data sources to enable online analytic processing (OLAP) (Jarke & Lenzerini & Vassiliou  &Vassiliadis, 2003).   Data Warehouse Components    Many researches and practitioners share the under standing that data warehouse architecture  can be understood as layers of materialized viewed on top of each other. Data  warehouse a r- chitecture can exhibit various layers. Data sources, also called operational databases, form the  lowest layer. They may cons ist of structured data stored in open database systems and legacy  systems or unstructured or semi structured data stored in files. They are usually heterogen e- ous, which means that the same data can be represented differently, for instance through di f- ferent  database schemata, in the sources . (Jarke et al., 2003)    The central layer in the architecture is the ""global"" data warehouse, sometimes called ""prim a- ry or corporate data warehouse."" The global data warehouse keeps a historical record of data.  Each time i t is changed, a new integrated snapshot of the underlying data sources from which  it is derived is placed in line with the previous snapshot. The data warehouse may contain data  that can be many years old (A frequently cited average age is two years) (Jark e et al., 2003).   Next layer of views are the ""local"" warehouses, which contain highly aggregated data derived  from the global warehouse, directly intended to support activities such as information  processing management decisions, long term decisions, histo rical analysis, trend analysis , or  integrated analysis",What is the main purpose of the thesis?,"['To create a data warehouse architecture for a telecom company.', 'To develop a customer service model for a telecom company.', 'To analyze the impact of IT on customer service in a telecom company.', ""To design a data warehouse for a telecom company's IT department.""]",1,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf

"The data warehouse may contain data  that can be many years old (A frequently cited average age is two years) (Jark e et al., 2003).   Next layer of views are the ""local"" warehouses, which contain highly aggregated data derived  from the global warehouse, directly intended to support activities such as information  processing management decisions, long term decisions, histo rical analysis, trend analysis , or  integrated analysis. In some cases an intermediate layer, called an operation data store, is i n- troduced between the operational data sources and the global data warehouse. (Jarke et al.,  2003)    All data warehouse componen ts, processes and data should at least be tracked and admin i- strated from a metadata store. The metadata store serves as an aid both to administrator and  the system designer of a data warehouse. Since the data warehouse is very complicated the  volume of dat a is huge, and the processes employed for the extraction, transformation, clea n- ing, storage and aggregation of data are numerous, sensitive to changes, and vary in time.  (Jarke et al., 2003)             13   4.2 Operational Data Store   The ODS grew in popularity in the 1990s, this was in part as a result of companies in the  midst of acquisitions and mergers. An operational data store can be described as a distribution  center for current data. The ODS serves as a consolidation point for reporting and can give the  business  one location for viewing current data that crosses divisions or departments (Gree n- wald, Stackowiak and Stern 2004).  A ODS may contain 30 to 60 days of information (Ra s- mussen, Goldy and Solli 2002). When a ODS is established the Warehouse server often e x- tracts data from the ODS, when a ODS isn't present, data for the warehouse is directly e x- tracted and transformed from operational sources.  (Greenwald, Stackowiak and Stern 2004)   The founder of the expression Bill Inmon explains ODS as following:   ""An ODS is a n integrated, subject - oriented, volatile (including update), current -valued stru c- ture designed to serve operational users as they do high performance integrated processing. ""   A ODS can deliver and achieve many things, some of the more known bene ficial  functionalities are:      Enabling integrated and c ollective on -line processing.    Delivering consistent high transaction performance.    On-line update.    It is integrated across many applications.    It creates a foundation for collective, up -to- the-second views of the  enterprise.    A ODS also supports decision support processing.   (Inmon 1998)     There are two main types of users that are attracted to the ODS, Farmers and Explorers. (I n- mon 1998)   Farmers are the first user type. Users belonging to this type do the same tasks over and over  again. They already know what they want to find in the ODS . They just look at small amounts  of data each transaction. As a farmer you usually find what you want. Although when you find  this it is usually a small flake of gold, not huge nuggets. Farmer operates in a world of stru c- ture--structured data, structured processing, structured procedures and so forth.  (Inmon 1998)    The other type of user is the explorer. Th e explorer is the opposite of the farmer . Explorers  work in a more random manner then the farmer; they do not know what they are looking for  at the outset of the analysis.  They operate in a heuristic mode. If you are an explorer you look  at very large sets  of data and associations between types of data. You try to find patterns that  are useful and relationship that has not been discovered yet. More than often the explorer does  not find anything as a result of his/hers analysis, but when they do they find hu ge nuggets of  gold. Explorer is the user type that best fits the description for our purpose of using a ODS in  this master thesis.  (Inmon 1998)              14   4.3 Stovepipe architecture and spider's web approach   A stovepipe architecture is an environment  with informa tion systems built with low or no  consideration to the functionality that exists today. In other words, many systems were  developed to complete one or several tasks, but not to share the functionality to other system  that exists or may be developed. This c reates a lot of redundant functionality within our IT  architecture, a lot of functionality is rebuilt each time a new system is introduced or an old  system is renewed",What is the average age of data in a data warehouse?,"['Two years', 'Five years', 'Ten years', 'Twenty years']",0,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf
"The data warehouse may contain data  that can be many years old (A frequently cited average age is two years) (Jark e et al., 2003).   Next layer of views are the ""local"" warehouses, which contain highly aggregated data derived  from the global warehouse, directly intended to support activities such as information  processing management decisions, long term decisions, histo rical analysis, trend analysis , or  integrated analysis.

"In other words, many systems were  developed to complete one or several tasks, but not to share the functionality to other system  that exists or may be developed. This c reates a lot of redundant functionality within our IT  architecture, a lot of functionality is rebuilt each time a new system is introduced or an old  system is renewed.   (Inmon 2003)        This is quite obvious expensive in development and execution, but the h ighest costs comes  from maintenance and in updates. Same functionality needs to be maintained and updated in  several places. Another major problem that the stovepipe environment creates is data being  shuffled from one system to another. The extraction appr oach, sometimes called the ""spider's  web"" approach, addresses the problem of the integrity of the data being shuffled. Data will be  sent when it is needed, but is this data reliable? Can the data from one system be  compromised in another, if data is update d in one system will this data also update in all the  others?   (Inmon 2003)       A root cause to this issue is that the budget cycle of a company and the career cycle of its top - level decision -makers decide and control the development of long term -life inform ation sy s- tem. The standpoint of this root cause can sound very reasonable, as Inmon expresses it:   ""If I, as a manager, commit to this course of action, can the action be completed while I am  still empowered? This seems like a reasonable stance. But from a budgetary standpoint is not  just shortsighted, it is VERY shortsighted. The problem with this stance is that it looks ONLY  at the development and deployment costs of the stovepipe being built. There are other entirely  different sets of costs ignored by thi s stance""   (Inmon 2003)   4.4 Business process execution language   Business Process Execution Language shortened to BPEL. BPEL is an XML -based language,  but BPEL is more specific and targeted. A programmer uses BPEL particularly to join disp a- rate functions into an integrated process which results in a flexible way to  use the internet to  conduct business transactions ranging from simple money exchanges, to complex calculations  and assets reallocation. (White 2003)   BPEL has been created by several people worki ng for a number of companies, some worth  mentioning are: Adobe, Avaya, BEA, Hewlett -Packard, IBM, Novell, Oracle, NEC, SAP, IBM  and Microsoft. But it wasn't until IBM´s Web Service Flow Language and Microsoft´s Xlang,  started back in 2002 things really sta rted to happen, since then it has been full speed ahead.  (White 2003)    Business process can be described in two ways. Executable business processes model actual  behavior of a participant in a business interaction. Abstract business processes are partially  specified processes that are not intended to be executed. Abstract Processes serve a descri p- tive role, with more than one possible use case, including observable behavior and process  template. WS -BPEL (Web Service BPEL) is meant to be used to model the beh avior of both  Executable and Abstract Processes. (OASIS 2007)        15   WS-BPEL provides a language for the specification of Executable and Abstract business  Processes. By doing so, it extends the Web Services interaction model and enables it to su p- port business tr ansactions. WS -BPEL defines an interoperable integration model that should  facilitate the expansion of automated process integration in both the intra -corporate and the  business -to-business spaces. (OASIS 2007)   4.5 Business rules engines   The term business rules means different things to different people, the term can be used so  widely that it becomes meaningless.   A reasonable definition of a business rule comes from GUIDE, an industry user group. It  states that a business rule is: "" A statement that define or constraints some aspects of business.  It is intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the  business ."" (Chisholm 2004)     Another example would be: ""A business rule is a simple statement  of Boolean logic. IF the  car is  low on gas THEN turn on the low -fuel light."" (Woolston 2006)    Because of the wide spread meaning of business rules it makes it difficult to apply all bus i- ness rules requirements to fit the rules engine. (Chisholm 2004)   Business rules engines are software applications that contain definitions of business rules","What are the two ways to describe business processes, and what is the difference between them?","['Executable and Abstract Processes; Executable Processes model actual behavior, while Abstract Processes are partially specified and serve a descriptive role.', 'Executable and Abstract Processes; Executable Processes are partially specified, while Abstract Processes model actual behavior.', 'Business and Abstract Processes; Business Processes model actual behavior, while Abstract Processes are partially specified and serve a descriptive role.', 'Business and Executable Processes; Business Processes are partially specified, while Executable Processes model actual behavior.']",0,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf
""" (Chisholm 2004)     Another example would be: ""A business rule is a simple statement  of Boolean logic. IF the  car is  low on gas THEN turn on the low -fuel light."" (Woolston 2006)    Because of the wide spread meaning of business rules it makes it difficult to apply all bus i- ness rules requirements to fit the rules engine. (Chisholm 2004)   Business rules engines are software applications that contain definitions of business rules.  There are many business rules engines on the market today, and they fill different kind of  needs. Broadly speaking they can be divided into two main groupings. The first are basically  interference en gines which can read information from a database and operate rules in order to  find answers to question s that users ask. The s econd group is more concerned with  obtain ing  result s that can be stored in a database after the result has been calculated. (Chish olm 2004)   4.6 Churn   Churn is a definition of customers that are likely to leave the company for another or better  offering.  (Middleton H, 2008)   When broadband is fast and doesn’t break down, who cares what company it  comes from .  Because of the Internet, co nsumers can learn what the lowest available price is for broadband  or phone service in their area. Result: churn – consumers are constantly taking advantage of  better offers and switching providers. (Middleton H, 2008)   One way to avoid churn is by using  mass marketing to persuade the public that your service is  somehow better. That process is called product differentiation. Telecoms are using mass ma r- keting today for telephone and broadband. But mass marketing is not doing enough to reduce  churn. (Middle ton H, 2008)   Churn is expensive, a typical Telco  or cable TV company spends over $200  to acquire a new  broadband or phone customer. When the customer switch, the company  lose not only the a c- quisition cost, but the revenue that the customer would have provi ded for a year or more.   But the Telecoms have a sign ificant advantage for marketing: they have customer s’ names and  addresses, and that can lead Telecoms to use a more cost effective marketing, database ma r- keting. (Middleton H, 2008)   Using database marketi ng, it is possible to build a relationship with the customers that will  keep them from leaving.  (Middleton H, 2008)      16     4.7 Semi structured interviews:   How to conduct semi structured interviews has been described by Stephen, Schensul, Sche n- sul, LeCompete (Stephen, Schensul, Schensul, LeCompete, 1999) . In summa ry they propose  the following:   Semi structured interviews combine the flexibility of the unstructured, open -ended interview  with the directionality  and agenda of the survey instrument to produce focused,  qualitative,  textual data.  The questions on a semi structured interview are pre -formulated, but the que s- tions to those are open -ended, they can be fully expanded at the discretion of the interviewer  and the interviewe e, and can be enhanced by probes. Semi  structured interviews plays an i m- portant role in the development of exploratory models and the preparation for the more sy s- tematic forms of investigation. A useful distinction between exploratory and explanatory r e- search  is that exploratory approaches are  used to develop hypothesis and probes are for ci r- cumscription, description and interpretation of less well understood topics.

"17       4.8 Interviews and observation techniques   The following is a list of interviews and observations  techniques :    By going into the interview / observation well prepared we will increase the credibility  as professionals (Oates 2006, p 189).    Anonymity is important to  create an environment where the person doesn't have to  fear later actions by superiors or be quoted in reports (Häger 2001, p 53).    The contact is very important. For those people that will not participate can infect  to  other people. To prevent this, it is important to have good arguments to why they  should participate (Andersson 1995, p 168).    When doing interviews and observational questions it is recommended to use open  questions ( Oates 2006, p 192) this encourages  the interviewee  to explain and evolve  their answers more accurately.    By asking indirect questions as for example:   ""What would a customer service representative  do in this situation"" instead of ""What  would you do in this situation"" will make the person bei ng interviewed more open and  honest (Häger 2001, p 74).    There are two different way to conduct the observations, overt or covert. Covert is  when the person being observed does not know of your presence as a researcher. Overt  is when the person being obser ved knows of your presence as a researcher (Oates  2006, p 204). A problem that can occur when using  overt observation is the Hawthorn  effect. The Hawthorn effect is that people may act differently when being observed  and can take a hostile stance (Häger 20 01, p 204).    Systematic observation is when you decide in advance what types of events you will  observe  (Häger 2001, p 204).   4.9 Questionnaire techniques   This is a list of key techniques taken from Bell's (Bell, 2005) discussion on different que s- tionnaire techniques:    Bell writes that you should think a lot of what you want to gain from your questio n- naire.    According to Bell  assumptions can lead to  respondents being confused, irritated or  even offended.    Bell mentions how lea ding questions are hard to spot.  Bell suggests not using emotive  language when building a question because this might more easily end up as a leading  question.    Bell also writes about how presumptions in questions often are a source of error .     18   5. Method   We have divided our over all method into  five studies, and  performed them in a chronological  order starting with  chapter 6 Customer service representative observations  and ending with   chapter  10 Interview with Senior IT Architect . We used a questionnaire to gather information  from the customer s ervice representatives, we interview ed three experts in the telecom bus i- ness and we performed observations on the customer service representatives.   After this we performed the analysis  described below  on the result from the interviews with  Ole Larsson and  Lage Eriksson.   Validation and reliability :  Long & Johnson discusses about the different views on reliability, they mention that there are  more than one way to look at it but all relate to confidence in data collection (T.Long,  M.Johnson, 2000). They cont inue to conclude that Reliability is recognized as being a part of   the stability of data collection measures .  To ensure our reliability we have used recognized interview, observati on and questionnaire  techniques.   Long & Johnson also discusses the idea of validity. They argue that validity is normally esta b- lished through consideration of three main aspects: Content validity, criterion -related validity  and construct validity.   Content validity reefers too the validity of our samples and instruments in accord ance to the  context of the study we are conducting (T.Long, M.Johnson, 2000). We feel we have ensured  content validity through choosing experts with solid expertise in their areas and also having a  good position in a recognized business. The sample of cust omer service representative was  not that good validated but as mentioned in our discussion we have to use the resource avail a- ble in some cases. The instrument was validated through recognized techniques and the co n- text of which the research was done is con sistent throughout all the studies.   Criterion -related validity is concerned with comparison of the instrument and findings with an  established standard to determine the correlation between measured performance and actual  performance (T.Long, M",What are the two types of observation techniques mentioned in the text?,"['Overt and covert observation', 'Structured and unstructured observation', 'Participant and non-participant observation', 'Observer-participant and observer-as-participant observation']",0,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf

They argue that validity is normally esta b- lished through consideration of three main aspects: Content validity, criterion -related validity  and construct validity.   Content validity reefers too the validity of our samples and instruments in accord ance to the  context of the study we are conducting (T.Long, M.Johnson, 2000).

The sample of cust omer service representative was  not that good validated but as mentioned in our discussion we have to use the resource avail a- ble in some cases. The instrument was validated through recognized techniques and the co n- text of which the research was done is con sistent throughout all the studies.   Criterion -related validity is concerned with comparison of the instrument and findings with an  established standard to determine the correlation between measured performance and actual  performance (T.Long, M",What is the purpose of using open-ended questions during interviews and observations?,"['To encourage interviewees to explain and elaborate their answers more accurately.', 'To gather quantitative data for statistical analysis.', ""To influence interviewees' responses and obtain biased answers."", 'To obtain a limited number of predetermined responses.']",0,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf
"17       4.8 Interviews and observation techniques   The following is a list of interviews and observations  techniques :    By going into the interview / observation well prepared we will increase the credibility  as professionals (Oates 2006, p 189).    Anonymity is important to  create an environment where the person doesn't have to  fear later actions by superiors or be quoted in reports (Häger 2001, p 53).    The contact is very important. For those people that will not participate can infect  to  other people. To prevent this, it is important to have good arguments to why they  should participate (Andersson 1995, p 168).    When doing interviews and observational questions it is recommended to use open  questions ( Oates 2006, p 192) this encourages  the interviewee  to explain and evolve  their answers more accurately.    By asking indirect questions as for example:   ""What would a customer service representative  do in this situation"" instead of ""What  would you do in this situation"" will make the person bei ng interviewed more open and  honest (Häger 2001, p 74).    There are two different way to conduct the observations, overt or covert. Covert is  when the person being observed does not know of your presence as a researcher. Overt  is when the person being obser ved knows of your presence as a researcher (Oates  2006, p 204). A problem that can occur when using  overt observation is the Hawthorn  effect. The Hawthorn effect is that people may act differently when being observed  and can take a hostile stance (Häger 20 01, p 204).    Systematic observation is when you decide in advance what types of events you will  observe  (Häger 2001, p 204).   4.9 Questionnaire techniques   This is a list of key techniques taken from Bell's (Bell, 2005) discussion on different que s- tionnaire techniques:    Bell writes that you should think a lot of what you want to gain from your questio n- naire.    According to Bell  assumptions can lead to  respondents being confused, irritated or  even offended.    Bell mentions how lea ding questions are hard to spot.  Bell suggests not using emotive  language when building a question because this might more easily end up as a leading  question.    Bell also writes about how presumptions in questions often are a source of error .     18   5.

"The instrument was validated through recognized techniques and the co n- text of which the research was done is con sistent throughout all the studies.   Criterion -related validity is concerned with comparison of the instrument and findings with an  established standard to determine the correlation between measured performance and actual  performance (T.Long, M.Johnson, 200 0). This is ensured through comparing the analysis r e- sult to recognized theories created by known authors and experts within each area. We also  sent the result to the people being interviewed so it could be approved to ensure that we have  not misinterprete d any facts.   Construct validity is associated with how good the instrument we chose is to generate the  wanted result (T.Long, M.Johnson, 2000). By using the different instruments of interviewing,  observation and conducting a questionnaire we feel we can en sure construct validity in our  information gather study. Because of lack of resources, interviews was the only instrument we  could use to collect data for our IT and business intelligence studies. Even so we feel we e n- sured the construct validity the best possible way.   Analysis  method   In the book “Researching information systems and Computing” by Briony J Oates (Oates,  2006), she explains the difference between Qualitative and Quantitative data analysis.  A c- cording to Oates Quantitative data means “data, or  evidence, based on numbers. It is the main  type of data generated by experiments and surveys, although it can be generated by other r e- search strategies too.” She continues explaining it by writing that it is primarily used and an a- lyzed by positivist resea rchers, but is sometimes generated by interpretive and critical r e- searchers too.  Qualitative data on the other hand she explains as data that includes all non     19   numeric data. Mostly found in things like interviews, researchers’ diaries, company doc u- ments. I nterpretive and critical researchers have this data as their main data but positivist r e- searcher may also use it. Since all of our data is qualitative we chose to use one of Oates a p- proaches to Qualitative data analysis which is explained below. First of a ll the data needs to  be prepared so it is ready for analysis. Duplicates will have to be made on our original data as  well as our analyzed data.  All the data have been read through at least once to get a general  impression of the text. We segmented all th e data into three different categories:    Segments that have no relation to our current research topic and should be disr e- garded.    Segments that provide general descriptive information needed in order to explain  things like history of the interviewer, locatio n and so on.    Segment that appear to be relevant to our research questions.   After this we need to focus on the third bullet, segments that appear to be relevant. We will  have to categorize each segment of this data; this by writing in the margin a label tha t de- scribes the theme presented by that segment.   We have chosen to categorize according to exi sting theories.     Figure 1: Example of categorizing.     After this we continue to  refine our categories. Some are too big and might need to be divided  into sub categories. Oates also empathizes on the importance of keeping an up -to-date list of  the categories.   Next we start to look for themes and connections between the segments and c ategories. We  look for patterns that may be present over a whole category by p asting all the segmented cat e- gories together and then reading it again to look for these patterns.       20   Oates continues with writing that the next step is trying to explain the patte rns we’ve located  in our categories. We should build up a theory about what our data “says” and then linking it  to any other theories we have in our original framework or to what the literature says.   To test our emerging theory Oates writes that you can se arch for contradictory evidence wit h- in the data. Also go back in the field to look for things that may support or contradict the  theory.          21   6.

We should build up a theory about what our data “says” and then linking it  to any other theories we have in our original framework or to what the literature says.   To test our emerging theory Oates writes that you can se arch for contradictory evidence wit h- in the data. Also go back in the field to look for things that may support or contradict the  theory.          21   6. Customer service representative observations   This chapter  is where we present our work with observation on a custo mer service  unit at Te- liSonera Sundsvall.   6.1 Purpose   The main purpose of doing observations was to get a better insight in how the customer se r- vice representative works  and what type of information they need",What was the significance of the finding that the instrument had high criterion-related validity?,"['It indicated that the instrument was able to measure what it was designed to measure.', 'It showed that the instrument was able to accurately predict real-world outcomes.', 'It demonstrated that the instrument was able to distinguish between people with different levels of knowledge or ability.', 'It proved that the instrument was free from bias and errors.']",0,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf

We also wanted to gain some input for questions we could ask the business intelligence per- son and the senior IT -architect.   6.2 Method   We started off  by joining the customer service representative  in his/hers daily work for one  day. This is to be well prep ared when going into the next stage  of observations and interviews  (Oates 2006, p 189). But we also wanted to create a good contact with the customer service   unit at an early stage as we previously explained and to show how their involvement could be  of benefit to them in the future  (Andersson 1995, p 168).   One month later we returned to the customer service  unit. At this time we were each given a  customer service representative to follow until lunch. After this we switched and were given  another represent ative to observe. This continued for two days, during this time we took notes  on what types of information parameters a customer service representative needs when dea l- ing wit h assurance and sales problems. We also tried to notice any information that might  be  lacking today.                                22   6.3 Result   By going through our notes and discussing the information areas we came up with the follo w- ing result.

Questionnaire   This chapter  is where we present  the questionnaire  we conducted on a customer service  unit at  TeliaSonera Sundsvall.   7.1 Purpose   The main purpose with t he questionnaire was to get customer service representatives ’ view s  on the different information parameters that they use in their systems. We wanted to locate  any specific areas that were especially trou blesome but also areas that were  exceptionally  smooth. We also wanted their input and suggestions on new information parameters that they  felt could be of use when handling customer issues and sales.   7.2 Method   Siv Svenshammar  provided us with five skilled customer service representativ es to answer the  questionnaire . In our initial thoughts the goal was to perform this questionnaire in a much  larger scale. The lack of resources made us change the questionnaire to more open ended  questions.  They all had four days t o answer the questionna ire, and they answered it in front of  their computer, as it is easier to answer the questionnaire  when the person could write the a n- swer directly when a n issue appears . But also because we did not want to interfere too much  with their daily work .  A questi onnaire can be either self -administrated or researcher admin i- strated (Oates 2006, p 219), we chose to use a self -administrated questionnaire.  The respo n- dents were given two full days of completing their questionnaire in their natural working e n- vironment.    7.3 Result   First part of the questioner c onsists  of check box answers.

Interview  with chief of a customer service unit   This chapter  is where we present the interview with Siv Svenshammar , chief of a customer  service unit at TeliaSonera Sundsvall.   8.1 Purpose   The main purpose with this interview was to get ideas and suggestions on how to improve and  add new parameters  to the existing i nformation areas. We also wanted to have an experts view  on what types of problems a customer service  unit experience today, especially within IT.   8.2 Method   The interview was held in a small conference room, and performed by Lage  Eriksson , Ale x- ander  Henriksson  and Fredric  Vallin . We used a semi -structured  interview  technique because  we wanted to ask open -ended questions , we also used all the techniques presented in 4. 8 In- terview and Observation techniques.  Before we posted the result, we send our wri tten answers  to Siv Svenshammar  to avoid any misinterpretations.    8.3 Result   Discussion area one     We wanted to know what Siv see as the biggest potential improvement area in IT.  Siv saw big  problems in error reporting and trouble shooting.  When a n error is discovered a lot of people  do not report it, and if they do there are very little tools to help them describe the situation in  which the error occurred.   When information is scattered and isn't easily available for the task at hand the service of fered  by the customer service representative  will be reduced","What are the problems that customer service units experience today, especially within IT?","['Insufficient information to effectively perform work.', 'Inadequate tools for error reporting and trouble shooting.', 'Lack of customer history and engagement information.', 'Inconsistent and outdated information.']",1,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf
"Siv saw big  problems in error reporting and trouble shooting.

When information is scattered and isn't easily available for the task at hand the service of fered  by the customer service representative  will be reduced. The customer service representative   cannot concentrate on being service minded but must instead put focus on locating inform a- tion.    Discussion area two:     We wanted to get Siv’s input on business  rules and how she experiences them.   Siv explained that there are a relative low amount of decision support rules, or “business  rules” enforced to help the customer service representative  make decisions in sales, assurance  and fulfillment.     Discussion area  three:     We wanted to know if there are any problems that have been noticed for a long time at  the  customer service  unit.  Siv tells us about how they suffer a lot from the information that is presented to the customer.  A lot of calls concerning bills are o ften not errors, but misinterpretations by the customer.   Discussion area four:      28     We wanted to give Siv the opportunity to give any feedback on areas in which we wanted IT  to improve.   - More information concerning the customer was requested, for example :  ""If we know that the customer hasn't plugged in its new TV package, we could call them and  offer them support in how to install this. This has been proven to be greatly appreciated in the  past.""   Let’s call the customer for assurance before they call us?   Analy sis:  We discussed the documentation from this interview and produced the following results:                    Figure 4: Result interview Siv        Outside the raw documentation of this result it will also create new routines in customer se r- vice unit. By knowing what services our customers don't use we can reach out and make co n- tact with them, asking if they would like assistance on how to use or install the service  not  used. This would increase the customer quality offered and also decrease the amount of calls  incoming.   In example:   A customer calls in to check if they can upgrade their internet connection, the customer se r- vice representative notices that the customer hasn't installed the digital TV box ordered two  months ago. After assisting the customer with help  on upgrading its internet connection the  customer service representative offers help on how to install and use the digital  TV box.  This can increase the quality experienced from the customer and also prevent any future calls  from this customer concerning the unused service.       29   9. Interview with business intelligence expert   This Chapter  is where we present our interview with Ole Larsson.   9.1 Purpose   The main purpose with this interview was to get an experts view on business intelligence in  the telecom industry. We wanted to know what problems are most common, how to solve  them and how to use each component the most efficient way.   We also wanted to as k the expert  question s we had after conducting the observations, inte r- view and questionnaire at the customer service  unit.  9.2 Method   We interviewed Ole Larsson as our expert in the business intelligence field. Ole has almost 43  years experience within the  telecom industry, and has worked with almost every known tec h- nology in the telecom area. At 1999 he finished his architectural course and has been working  with architecture problems since then. Ole is currently working at Solution architecture defin i- tion for business intelligence and data warehouse for enterprise data warehouse at TeliaSon e- ra.   This interview was conducted via phone from a small conference room at TeliaSonera  Sundsvall. We used a semi structured interview with all the tec hniques explained in 4.8  Inter- view and observation techniques.   9.3 Result   Ole started with presenting  the Business intelligence area. He starts off by dividing the data  warehouse flows in different levels:   He first defines Operational data store (ODS) as the most operative  level, this is what he  usually defines as tactical reporting.

"8  Inter- view and observation techniques.   9.3 Result   Ole started with presenting  the Business intelligence area. He starts off by dividing the data  warehouse flows in different levels:   He first defines Operational data store (ODS) as the most operative  level, this is what he  usually defines as tactical reporting. He further explains it as creating data that becomes avai l- able in tactic, in other words how you act in different situations.   Next layer is traditional data warehouse, strategic reporting wher e you follow up and improve  over time.   Next layers is simulation and data mining, or advanced analyzing this is where you  can do  profiling and search for unknown patterns in the large quantities of data. The data is used for  profiling here, which is when  you categorize objects like customers.   Ole continues and explains that some people also structures data warehouse in sourcing, ma n- aging and using. Data sourcing is when you load data from a number of sources or export  data. Worst case scenario here is wh en you just want some data from a source but get handed  a dump of the whole database. In these cases you will have to extract from that dump.   Ole then talks about data mart, and how it is like a model that is optimized for the reports,  where data is stored in an efficient way. Ole talks about Inmons structure where process ne u- tral data layers are used, business rules can later be applied to these data layer to make them  understandable to the business. This is the structure that Ole has chosen to go wi th since he  thinks that the data becomes more useful because of the option to use it for both tactics and     30   strategy but also profiling and simulations you would like to do on the data.     Ole continues and tells us that when data is bought from external servi ces he wants it to be  brought into the warehouse environment through the operative systems, as all the other data  would be taken in. Business object is a general updating tool that can be used for both oper a- tive and tactical export of data. This data can a lso be exported to other receivers, like other  systems or another customer.   Ole tells us that in their systems you can send a message to a server over a  transport. This  message gets then converted to questions that goes into an Oracle database and calls a Stall  Procedure. This Stall procedure then does a database query and fetches the data that gets sent  back to the JBOSS server, which in turn sends it back the way it came. If the data is too big or  to complex so that it efficiently can be sent in a message  the answer gets uploaded into a file  and a message is sent to the system that it may retrieve the file.   We proceeded with discussing around and asking questions concerning different areas in the  Business intelligence area.   Discussion area one:     We talk about profiling of customers and demography.   Ole can’t see any problems concerning profiling and demography in BI but only possibilities.  He believes that profiling data that support for example Churn is very suitable to do in a  warehouse environment; the tools are practically made for those services.    Ole also tells us about the possibility to outsource the profiling part of the data to an external  company; these companies can be specialized on just profiling. They might have more eff i- cient databases that are column oriented.   Discussion area two:     We talk about resources and how demanding BI is.   Ole tells us that BI definitely is heavy on the resources and that you can’t profile “on - demand”. Profiling will have to be done before the customer have called, th e only thing that  can be done on demand is the profile that is already done.   Discussion area three:     We talk about how the situation with widely spread information throughout many systems  affects BI. When information is scattered all around the IT architec ture is it hard to get a 360  degree customer view?   Ole explains that it is not the fetching of data that is problematic; it is easy to just fetch the  data from a specific part of the architecture. There is also no problem to load that data into a  normalize d general model. A big problem is to work with a requirement base that where you  have to consider requirements that are 15 years and at the same time building an enterprise  warehouse with a modern thought in mind.

"8  Inter- view and observation techniques.   9.3 Result   Ole started with presenting  the Business intelligence area. He starts off by dividing the data  warehouse flows in different levels:   He first defines Operational data store (ODS) as the most operative  level, this is what he  usually defines as tactical reporting. He further explains it as creating data that becomes avai l- able in tactic, in other words how you act in different situations.   Next layer is traditional data warehouse, strategic reporting wher e you follow up and improve  over time.   Next layers is simulation and data mining, or advanced analyzing this is where you  can do  profiling and search for unknown patterns in the large quantities of data. The data is used for  profiling here, which is when  you categorize objects like customers.   Ole continues and explains that some people also structures data warehouse in sourcing, ma n- aging and using. Data sourcing is when you load data from a number of sources or export  data. Worst case scenario here is wh en you just want some data from a source but get handed  a dump of the whole database. In these cases you will have to extract from that dump.   Ole then talks about data mart, and how it is like a model that is optimized for the reports,  where data is stored in an efficient way. Ole talks about Inmons structure where process ne u- tral data layers are used, business rules can later be applied to these data layer to make them  understandable to the business. This is the structure that Ole has chosen to go wi th since he  thinks that the data becomes more useful because of the option to use it for both tactics and     30   strategy but also profiling and simulations you would like to do on the data.     Ole continues and tells us that when data is bought from external servi ces he wants it to be  brought into the warehouse environment through the operative systems, as all the other data  would be taken in. Business object is a general updating tool that can be used for both oper a- tive and tactical export of data. This data can a lso be exported to other receivers, like other  systems or another customer.   Ole tells us that in their systems you can send a message to a server over a  transport. This  message gets then converted to questions that goes into an Oracle database and calls a Stall  Procedure. This Stall procedure then does a database query and fetches the data that gets sent  back to the JBOSS server, which in turn sends it back the way it came. If the data is too big or  to complex so that it efficiently can be sent in a message  the answer gets uploaded into a file  and a message is sent to the system that it may retrieve the file.   We proceeded with discussing around and asking questions concerning different areas in the  Business intelligence area.   Discussion area one:     We talk about profiling of customers and demography.   Ole can’t see any problems concerning profiling and demography in BI but only possibilities.  He believes that profiling data that support for example Churn is very suitable to do in a  warehouse environment; the tools are practically made for those services.    Ole also tells us about the possibility to outsource the profiling part of the data to an external  company; these companies can be specialized on just profiling.

This is something that separates the operative systems from the data warehouse; a data war e- house handles a lot more of Meta data.      31   Another part of the proble m is when you are merging two different areas into one data mart;  making the data in the two areas coherent can easily cause problems. Ole tells us that the cha l- lenge lies in the data mart layer. You can easily retrieve data with the help of Meta data but it’s  the way out that is tricky, when applying business rules to the data taking it back into the  business.   Discussion area four:     We talked about the possibility to check if the customer uses the services they are paying for.  Like the channels they are su bscribing to or internet connection they have.   Ole explains that you can’t give a direct answer to this question. You first have to know what  information you want to know from the business side. When this is known you just check if  the data exists in the m odel we currently have. If this data already exists in the model, that  being if the operative systems feed the BI with this information according to the model, then it  is relatively easy to get the information.  On the other hand if the information isn’t i n our cu r- rent model we’ll have to change the extract of the operative system. The development cycles  of the systems are fairly long and you’ll have to wait for quarterly releases and so on.

Discussion area five:     We talked about how to solve the issue of creating a mutual bill for all the customers’ e n- gagement in Telia Sonera . We wanted to get Oles perspective on how to solve this.   Ole agrees tha t this is a big issue, but he continues to tell us that he does not believe it is a  problem that should be solved in data warehouse. This is, according to Ole, a problem that  should be solved by the billing systems. Ole tells us that the structure of a bil ling system and  data warehouse is quite the same. This causes problems because people often do “quick fixes”  in the data warehouse to solve a billing system issue. These “quick fixes” often becomes pe r- manent and are the root of many problems.   Discussion area six:     We talked about using BI as a solution to help the customer service representative  with error  reporting. To be able to send error reports containing web logs automatically when a error  occurs instead of manually explaining it and sending.   This i s what Ole calls portal and web logging. He explains that this is a area he haven’t done  much work himself but have been in contact with a lot of people working in this area. Ole  continues and tells us that ODS was partly started because of the customer co ntact was b e- coming increasingly low; instead people were conducting their errands online. They were  losing the possibility to supervise patterns and to follow the customers’ reactions. This is  where ODS came in and you could create requirements on what to log in the portals and web  applications used. Ole tells us that web logging like this is not easy, especially not when tr y- ing to do it as close to real time as you can, but it is possible.   Discussion area seven:     We ask about the process from a idea of new  information to it actually being used in i.e.  a  customer service  unit.      32   Ole tells us that there is a organizational unit that has a forum for exchange of requirements. If  they reach the conclusion that there should be some new information included they re gister  this as a errand. The errands get prioritized and if they are big enough a project leader gets  assigned.

Ole tells us that web logging like this is not easy, especially not when tr y- ing to do it as close to real time as you can, but it is possible.   Discussion area seven:     We ask about the process from a idea of new  information to it actually being used in i.e.  a  customer service  unit.      32   Ole tells us that there is a organizational unit that has a forum for exchange of requirements. If  they reach the conclusion that there should be some new information included they re gister  this as a errand. The errands get prioritized and if they are big enough a project leader gets  assigned.

The errands get prioritized and if they are big enough a project leader gets  assigned.     Discussion area eight:     We want to know what the hardest part of BI is.   Ole starts by telling us that working with requirements is often quite difficult. This is because  of the environment that their warehouse is in today, with a lot of warehouses overlapping and  integrating with each other. He also tells us that the underlying structure isn’t that easy to  work with. Ole continues by telling us t hat the most time is lost when you are receiving new  data from the operative systems. Ole tells us that the attention from the different areas isn’t  what you could wish for. This often results in quick fixes that increase the complexity. Many  times you are  offered a “dump” from the technical administrator because that is something  they always can deliver. These “dumps” are often very difficult to interpret, how does the data  relate to each other?  If you ask the technical administrator they do have supporti ng this  “dump” in their plans. This is something Ole would like to change from the start.   Discussion area nine:     We continue on the last subject and ask how the data really should be delivered?   Ole starts by pointing out that all the transactions should be  logged in the extraction. He’d like  to see the data arriving in a message, preferably a JMS queue that gets read. If this isn’t poss i- ble Ole suggests that you should get a file with the data through a file clearing house. This is  that you have a secure fi le transfer with transaction history and so on. The “dumps” should  definitely be avoided.   Discussion area eleven:     Finally we ask Ole if he can see any need for new information at customer service that doesn’t  exist today.   Ole starts by pointing out that there are very much information that is unused today. He thinks  that we can combine data in the normalized database. Ole tells us that storing process neutral  information is always possible to do for a lot of goals, but storing business data that is data  with business rules attached we always do it for a purpose. If we want to plan for the future  we should look at the operative systems. You should look on what is going to stay and which  requirements are going to be added.                             33   Analysis:     We analyzed  the result from this interview according to the  analysis  method explained in 5.  Method. The following model on Business intelligence was created.           Figure 5: Result i nterview  Ole            34       This analysis also resulted in some guidelines that explain how to communicate and what i s- sues to look out for.   How to communicate:   To communicate with the warehouse e nvironment we want the operational  system to send a  XML message to a server over a JMS transport. This message then gets converted to ques- tions that go  into a database. Within the database we do a database query and fetch the data  that gets sent back to the server, which in turn sends it back the way it came. If the data is too  big or too complex to efficiently be sent in a message the answer gets uploaded in to a file and  a message is sent to the system that it may retrieve the file.   If data is bought from external services it should be imported in to the data warehouse env i- ronment the same way as all the other data.   Issues:   A big problem is to work with legac y requirements and at the same time consid er building a  modern  enterprise wareho use.   Merging two different areas into one data mart is a problem and  making the data coherent can  easily cause problems.   Retrieving data with the help of meta data isn't that hard, but a challenge lies in applying bus i- ness rules to the data and taking it back into the business.   Quite obvious ""quick fixes"" causes a lot of problems in the warehouse environment.

If the data is too  big or too complex to efficiently be sent in a message the answer gets uploaded in to a file and  a message is sent to the system that it may retrieve the file.   If data is bought from external services it should be imported in to the data warehouse env i- ronment the same way as all the other data.   Issues:   A big problem is to work with legac y requirements and at the same time consid er building a  modern  enterprise wareho use.   Merging two different areas into one data mart is a problem and  making the data coherent can  easily cause problems.   Retrieving data with the help of meta data isn't that hard, but a challenge lies in applying bus i- ness rules to the data and taking it back into the business.

"Quite obvious ""quick fixes"" causes a lot of problems in the warehouse environment. ""Quick  fixes"" are made to help  solve problems in the operational  systems but often becomes perm a- nent and increases the complexity. These fixes are the root of many problems.   A lot of time is lost when recei ving new data from the operational  systems. If you ask for sp e- cific data you often get offered a ""dump"", because  this is something the operational  systems  always can deliver. These ""dumps"" are often very difficult to interpret and the technical a d- ministrator does not have supporting these dumps on their schedule.        35   10. Interview with Senior IT Architect   This chapter  presents our interview with Lage Eriksson.   10.1 Purpose   The main purpose with this interview was to get an experts view on IT in the telecom indu s- try. We wanted to know what problems are most common, how to solve them and how to use  each component the mos t efficient way.   10.2 Method   We interviewed Lage Eriksson as our expert in IT within the telecom industry. Lage has 26  years experience within the telecom industry. He started at a company called Datacom 1984  where he joined a project for establishing a dr ift and data network to replace the old magnetic  band for collecting call records and traffic measurements. 1994 he became region chief, 1996  he started to work in a network architecture unit their tasks was to look at new techniques,  like V oIP and other t hings. After that he worked in a project that established ADSL solutions.  And now he work as Chief Architect for business broadband Sweden.   The interview was conducted via phone from Alexander’s resident in Uppsala. We used a  semi structured interview with  all the techniques explained in 4.8  Interview and observation  techniques.   10.3 Result   Discussion area one:     We asked Lage to do a general presentation over his thoughts on the main subjects in our th e- sis, BPEL, BI, Information at  a customer service  unit and business rules.   Lage starts off by saying that BPEL isn’t something you can use everywhere. The place where  it isn’t usable is where you have existing legacy systems where we cannot go in and change.  Though you can use it at modern solutions, usually portal application where we can create a  couple of composite SOA services from underlying services. These can we later expose with  for example IDS Sheers ARIS.   The biggest advantage is when you can combine a BPEL motor with a process tool and start  to desc ribe your processes. Then you can connect this with a business rules engine where the  business themselves can set rules and requirements for our processes without assistance of  technical support. These rules can be for example how you treat a customer depe nding if its  gold or silver. But it can also be rules that look if the customer has had a lot of complaints or  its current engagement and what types of offerings we currently have.  The offerings shown to  the customer service representative  is only offerin gs that the customer technically can use and  also offerings that fit this customer’s profile.    You can also manipulate the processes with BAM (Business Activity Monitor), in BAM you  put measuring points in your BPEL flows.   This sums up in two big areas t hat a customer service  unit can benefit from , first of the cu s- tomers engagement alongside with offerings, churn and patterns. Secondly to b e a support to  the error analysis  in which case the customer  themselves could apply test to their hardware     36   and connec tivity. Also the area of ODS to be able to create more information about the cu s- tomer, combining it with the operative data that exists in CRM and billing systems.     Discussion area two:     We talked about the structuring of the components we currently have, how to see them and  make use of them. As we saw it we had information at  the customer service  unit, business  intelligence, ODS and BPEL with business rules.   Lage explains that his view on the components we are exploring is that we should not see  them as layers but rather see them as tools to use at specific places in our IT environment.  Certain part of our main process flows may be eligible to use this technol ogy with BPEL,  business rules and so on. More like looking for customer close service oriented processes  which we can renew and use this idea on","What are the two big areas that a customer service unit can benefit from, according to Lage Eriksson?","['Business Activity Monitor and Business Rules', 'Business Intelligence and Operative Data', 'Customer Engagement and Offerings', 'Error Analysis and Testing Hardware']",2,Telcom_Customer_Service_Information.pdf
