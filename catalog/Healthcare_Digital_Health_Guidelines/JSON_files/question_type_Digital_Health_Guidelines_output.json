                    "expected_output": "The Health Information Unit (HIU) plays a crucial role in the issuance of Personal Health Numbers (PHNs) in Sri Lanka's healthcare system. It is responsible for assigning unique identification numbers to healthcare institutions, known as Point of Issue (POI) IDs, which are used to generate PHNs. The HIU also ensures that no duplications occur in the PHNs issued for each POI ID by generating a unique random alphanumeric string for each PHN. Additionally, the HIU maintains a National Master Patient Index (MPI) that contains information about healthcare recipients, which can be used to positively identify individuals within the health system. The MPI services are used to validate PHNs and ensure their accuracy. Moreover, the HIU maintains a registry of healthcare institutions, known as the Healthcare Facility Registry, which contains information about healthcare institutions, including their unique identification numbers (Health Institution Numbers (HINs)). The HIU also maintains a Healthcare Provider Registry that contains information about healthcare workers who have a role in state sector digital health systems. By maintaining these registries and utilizing standardized algorithms, the HIU ensures the uniqueness and accuracy of PHNs across different healthcare institutions in Sri Lanka's healthcare system."
