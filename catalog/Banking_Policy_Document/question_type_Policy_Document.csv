Additionally, a certificate should be sent to the concerned Zone and HO Department about having destroyed the old records along with details of the records destroyed. To ensure that the destruction has been completed properly, the officer should ensure that the records are completely burned or converted into pulp, and a certificate should be obtained from the local branch incumbent in-charge.
