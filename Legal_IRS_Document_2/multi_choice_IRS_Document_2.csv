For help in determining if you are eligible for the EIC, go to IRS.gov/EITC  and click on “Check if You Qualify.” This service  is available in English and Spanish. If you take the EIC even though you aren't eligible and  it is determined that your error is due to reckless or in- tentional disregard of the EIC rules, you won't be al- lowed to take the credit for 2 years even if you are otherwise eli- gible to do so. If you fraudulently take the EIC, you won't be al- lowed to take the credit for 10 years. See Form 8862, who must  file, later. You may also have to pay penalties.

If the name or SSN on  your social security card is incorrect,  call the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to  file your tax return. Use your SSN to file  your tax return even if your SSN does  not authorize employment or if you have  been issued an SSN that authorizes em- ployment and you lose your employ- ment authorization. An ITIN will not be  issued to you once you have been issued  an SSN. If you received your SSN after  previously using an ITIN, stop using  your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer  Identification Numbers  (ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien  and you don’t have and aren’t eligible to  get an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN.  It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it  wherever your SSN is requested on your  tax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you  haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax  return at least once for tax years 2020,  2021, or 2022, it has expired and must  be renewed if you need to file a federal  tax return. You don't need to renew your  ITIN if you don't need to file a federal  tax return. You can find more informa- tion at IRS.gov/ITIN . ITINs assigned before 2013  have expired and must be re- newed if you need to file a tax  return. If you previously submitted a re- newal application and it was approved,  you do not need to renew again unless  you haven't used your ITIN on a federal  tax return at least once for tax years  2020, 2021, or 2022. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't  entitle you to social security benefits or  change your employment or immigra- tion status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, in- cluding application, expiration, and re- newal, see Form W -7 and its instruc- tions. If you receive an SSN after previous- ly using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN.  TIPUse your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS  office or write a letter to the IRS ex- plaining that you now have an SSN and  want all your tax records combined un- der your SSN. Details about what to in- clude with the letter and where to mail it  are at IRS.gov/ITIN . Nonresident Alien Spouse If your spouse is a nonresident alien,  your spouse must have either an SSN or  an ITIN if: •You file a joint return, or •Your spouse is filing a separate re- turn. Presidential Election  Campaign Fund This fund helps pay for Presidential  election campaigns. The fund reduces  candidates' dependence on large contri- butions from individuals and groups and  places candidates on an equal financial  footing in the general election. The fund  also helps pay for pediatric medical re- search. If you want $3 to go to this fund,  check the box. If you are filing a joint  return, your spouse can also have $3 go  to the fund. If you check a box, your tax  or refund won't change. Filing Status Check only the filing status that applies  to you.

Once you  file a joint return, you can't choose to  file separate returns for that year after  the due date of the return. Joint and several tax liability.  If you  file a joint return, both you and your  spouse are generally responsible for the  tax and interest or penalties due on the  return. This means that if one spouse  doesn't pay the tax due, the other may  have to. Or, if one spouse doesn't report  the correct tax, both spouses may be re- sponsible for any additional taxes as- sessed by the IRS. You may want to file  separately if: •You believe your spouse isn't re- porting all of their income, or •You don’t want to be responsible  for any taxes due if your spouse doesn't  have enough tax withheld or doesn't pay  enough estimated tax.

For electronic filing, enter the spou- se's name or “NRA” if the spouse  doesn’t have an SSN or ITIN in the en- try space below the filing status check- boxes. If you are married and file a separate  return, you generally report only your  own income, deductions, and credits.  Generally, you are responsible only for  the tax on your own income. Different  rules apply to people in community  property states; see Pub. 555. However, you will usually pay more  tax than if you use another filing status  for which you qualify. Also, if you file a  separate return, you can't take the stu- dent loan interest deduction or the edu- cation credits, and you will only be able  to take the earned income credit and  child and dependent care credit in very  limited circumstances.

Single You can check the “Single” box at the  top of Form 1040 or 1040 -SR if any of  the following was true on December 31,  2023. •You were never married. •You were legally separated accord- ing to your state law under a decree of  divorce or separate maintenance. But if,  TIPat the end of 2023, your divorce wasn't  final (an interlocutory decree), you are  considered married and can't check the  box. •You were widowed before January  1, 2023, and didn't remarry before the  end of 2023. But if you have a child,  you may be able to use the qualifying  surviving spouse filing status. See the  instructions for Qualifying Surviving  Spouse , later. Married Filing Jointly You can check the “Married filing joint- ly” box at the top of Form 1040 or  1040-SR if any of the following apply. •You were married at the end of  2023, even if you didn't live with your  spouse at the end of 2023. •Your spouse died in 2023 and you  didn't remarry in 2023. •You were married at the end of  2023 and your spouse died in 2024 be- fore filing a 2023 return. A married couple filing jointly report  their combined income and deduct their  combined allowable expenses on one re- turn. They can file a joint return even if  only one had income or if they didn't  live together all year. However, both  persons must sign the return. Once you  file a joint return, you can't choose to  file separate returns for that year after  the due date of the return. Joint and several tax liability.  If you  file a joint return, both you and your  spouse are generally responsible for the  tax and interest or penalties due on the  return. This means that if one spouse  doesn't pay the tax due, the other may  have to. Or, if one spouse doesn't report  the correct tax, both spouses may be re- sponsible for any additional taxes as- sessed by the IRS. You may want to file  separately if: •You believe your spouse isn't re- porting all of their income, or •You don’t want to be responsible  for any taxes due if your spouse doesn't  have enough tax withheld or doesn't pay  enough estimated tax.

However, if you were a nonresi- dent alien or a dual-status alien and were  married to a U.S. citizen or resident ali- en at the end of 2023, you can elect to  be treated as a resident alien and file a  joint return. See Pub. 519 for details. Married Filing Separately Check the “Married filing separately”  box at the top of Form 1040 or 1040 -SR  if you are married, at the end of 2023,  and file a separate return. Enter your  spouse’s name in the entry space below  the filing status checkboxes. Be sure to  enter your spouse’s SSN or Individual  Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)  in the space for spouse’s SSN on Form  1040 or 1040 -SR. If your spouse doesn’t  have and isn’t required to have an SSN  or ITIN, enter “NRA” in the entry space  below the filing status checkboxes. For electronic filing, enter the spou- se's name or “NRA” if the spouse  doesn’t have an SSN or ITIN in the en- try space below the filing status check- boxes. If you are married and file a separate  return, you generally report only your  own income, deductions, and credits.  Generally, you are responsible only for  the tax on your own income. Different  rules apply to people in community  property states; see Pub. 555. However, you will usually pay more  tax than if you use another filing status  for which you qualify. Also, if you file a  separate return, you can't take the stu- dent loan interest deduction or the edu- cation credits, and you will only be able  to take the earned income credit and  child and dependent care credit in very  limited circumstances. You also can't  take the standard deduction if your  spouse itemizes deductions",Why might a couple want to file separately?,"[""If one spouse doesn't report all of their income."", ""If one spouse doesn't want to be responsible for any taxes due if the other spouse doesn't have enough tax withheld or doesn't pay enough estimated tax."", 'If one spouse is a nonresident alien at any time during the year.', 'If one spouse wants to claim the student loan interest deduction or education credits.']",1
