Litigation, investigations and reviews The Group is party to a number of legal proceedings, and the subject of various investigations and reviews. Provisions have been raised  in accordance with the principles outlined in the accounting policy section of this note. Litigation The main litigated claims against the Group as at 30 June 2023 are summarised below. Bankwest class action In 2016, class action proceedings were filed against CBA in the Supreme Court of NSW. The plaintiffs allege that in the period from 19 December 2008 to 1 October 2012, following the acquisition of Bankwest from HBOS in 2008, Bankwest implemented a system (involving a review of loan files) to enable it to identify, remove and write-off commercial loans, notwithstanding that the loans were  performing loans at the time. This is alleged to have amounted to unconscionable conduct and breach of contract (including of the Code of Banking Practice). Following a mediation in March 2023, a settlement was reached with no admissions as to liability. The settlement is subje ct to Court approval. The Group has provided for the legal costs expected to be incurred in this matter. The Group does not expect to incur a loss as a result of the settlement. Shareholder class actions In October 2017 and June 2018 two separate shareholder class action proceedings were filed against CBA in the Federal Court of  Australia, alleging breaches of CBA’s continuous disclosure obligations and misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to t he subject matter of the civil penalty proceedings brought against CBA by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRA C). The  AUSTRAC proceedings concerned contraventions of the Anti -Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). The resolution of the AUSTRAC civil penalty proceedings was approved by the Federal Court on 20 June 2018 with CBA paying a penalty of $700 million and legal costs. It is alleged in the class actions that CBA shareholders who acquired an interest in CBA shares between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017  suffered losses as a result of the alleged conduct. The two class actions are being case managed together, with a single harm onised statement of claim. CBA denies the allegations made against it, and is def ending the proceedings. A trial took place in November and December 2022 and judgement is reserved. It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on the Group. Superannuation class actions The Group is also defending three class actions in relation to superannuation products. On 9 October 2018, a class action was filed against Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) and CBA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim initially related to investment in cash and deposit options (which are cash and deposit products provided by CBA) in the Colonial First State First Choice Superannuation Trust (FirstChoice Fund) and Commonwealth Essential Super and later expanded tojoin Avanteos Investments Limited (AIL) as a party in respect of claims regarding the FirstWrap Pooled Cash Account. The main claims are that members that invested in these cash and deposit options received lower interest rates than they coul d have received had CFSIL/AIL offered similar products made available in the market by another bank with comparable risk and that CFSIL/AIL  retained the margin that arises through the internal transfer pricing process in respect of deposits made with CBA, for their own benefit. It is claimed CFSIL/AIL breached their duties as a trustee of the funds, CFSIL breached its duties as a Responsible Entity of the underlying managed investment schemes and that CBA was involved in CFSIL/AIL’s breaches. CBA, CFSIL and AIL deny the allegations and aredefending the proceedings. The Court has ordered that mediation occur by 14 June 2024. On 18 October 2019, a second class action was commenced against CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to certain  fees charged to members of the FirstChoice Fund",What is the wealth remediation provision included in the text?,"['An estimate of customer refunds relating to certain superannuation and other products, and the related program costs.', 'A settlement reached with no admissions as to liability regarding the Bankwest class action.', 'Payment of a penalty of $700 million and legal costs concerning contraventions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).', 'Compensation for losses allegedly suffered by CBA shareholders who acquired an interest in CBA shares between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017.']",0

Shareholder class actions In October 2017 and June 2018 two separate shareholder class action proceedings were filed against CBA in the Federal Court of  Australia, alleging breaches of CBA’s continuous disclosure obligations and misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to t he subject matter of the civil penalty proceedings brought against CBA by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRA C). The  AUSTRAC proceedings concerned contraventions of the Anti -Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). The resolution of the AUSTRAC civil penalty proceedings was approved by the Federal Court on 20 June 2018 with CBA paying a penalty of $700 million and legal costs. It is alleged in the class actions that CBA shareholders who acquired an interest in CBA shares between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017  suffered losses as a result of the alleged conduct. The two class actions are being case managed together, with a single harm onised statement of claim. CBA denies the allegations made against it, and is def ending the proceedings. A trial took place in November and December 2022 and judgement is reserved. It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on the Group. Superannuation class actions The Group is also defending three class actions in relation to superannuation products. On 9 October 2018, a class action was filed against Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) and CBA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim initially related to investment in cash and deposit options (which are cash and deposit products provided by CBA) in the Colonial First State First Choice Superannuation Trust (FirstChoice Fund) and Commonwealth Essential Super and later expanded tojoin Avanteos Investments Limited (AIL) as a party in respect of claims regarding the FirstWrap Pooled Cash Account. The main claims are that members that invested in these cash and deposit options received lower interest rates than they coul d have received had CFSIL/AIL offered similar products made available in the market by another bank with comparable risk and that CFSIL/AIL  retained the margin that arises through the internal transfer pricing process in respect of deposits made with CBA, for their own benefit. It is claimed CFSIL/AIL breached their duties as a trustee of the funds, CFSIL breached its duties as a Responsible Entity of the underlying managed investment schemes and that CBA was involved in CFSIL/AIL’s breaches. CBA, CFSIL and AIL deny the allegations and aredefending the proceedings. The Court has ordered that mediation occur by 14 June 2024. On 18 October 2019, a second class action was commenced against CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to certain  fees charged to members of the FirstChoice Fund",What is the main claim made in the first superannuation class action?,"['Members received lower interest rates than they could have received had CFSIL/AIL offered similar products made available in the market by another bank with comparable risk.', 'CFSIL/AIL retained the margin that arises through the internal transfer pricing process in respect of deposits made with CBA, for their own benefit.', ""CFSIL/AIL breached their duties as a trustee of the funds, CFSIL breached its duties as a Responsible Entity of the underlying managed investment schemes, and CBA was involved in CFSIL/AIL's breaches."", 'Members suffered losses as a result of the alleged conduct.']",0

Litigation, investigations and reviews The Group is party to a number of legal proceedings, and the subject of various investigations and reviews. Provisions have been raised  in accordance with the principles outlined in the accounting policy section of this note. Litigation The main litigated claims against the Group as at 30 June 2023 are summarised below. Bankwest class action In 2016, class action proceedings were filed against CBA in the Supreme Court of NSW. The plaintiffs allege that in the period from 19 December 2008 to 1 October 2012, following the acquisition of Bankwest from HBOS in 2008, Bankwest implemented a system (involving a review of loan files) to enable it to identify, remove and write-off commercial loans, notwithstanding that the loans were  performing loans at the time. This is alleged to have amounted to unconscionable conduct and breach of contract (including of the Code of Banking Practice). Following a mediation in March 2023, a settlement was reached with no admissions as to liability. The settlement is subje ct to Court approval. The Group has provided for the legal costs expected to be incurred in this matter. The Group does not expect to incur a loss as a result of the settlement.

We acknowledge community and  stakeholder expectations that theremuneration of Executives should becommensurate and closely aligned  to balanced financial and non‑financial performance outcomes, appropriately governed, and support sustainable long‑term value creation. This has been our strong focus as a Board and it is pleasing that the Group has continued to build on our robust risk management foundations and demonstrate our values of Care, Courage and Commitment to progress our strategy of building tomorrow’s bank today for our customers. Our focus on sustainable performance has underpinned another year of good outcomes for our customers and stakeholders and that is reflected inexecutive remuneration outcomes. Financial performance and  target setting The Group overall and the Executive  Leadership Team (ELT) have performed strongly this year. Cash Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) was $10,182 million, up5%, and the Bank’s capital position  remains strong. These results demonstrate disciplined  execution of our strategic priorities, and  growth in a challenging and competitivemarket. Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June2023 was above peers and dividendsreturned to shareholders were higherthan the prior year. As the Board monitored Executives’  performance during the financial year, it became apparent that rapidly changing macroeconomic factors, in particular central bank interest rate increases, differed from our assumptions at the start of the year. This warranted a mid‑year review ofthe financial targets. The Board therefore exercised its discretion to increase the Group NPAT and Profit after Capital Charge (PACC) targets mid‑year, an action that was considered to be fair to our shareholders and our Executives given the extraordinary market conditions. Through excellent financial management and operational execution, Group NPAT and PACC results materially exceeded these more challenging targets, a good outcome  for our shareholders.

Our ESG obligations and ambitions are  prioritised as they are integral to our  purpose to build a brighter future for  all, critical to our overarching strategy,  and are incorporated in e xecutive  performance scorecards and  risk milestones.  The Bank has continued to make  progress towards achievement of its  gender diversity goals, and has  maintained high levels of employee  engagement. Our corporate reputation,  as measured independently by RepTrak,  is the highest among our peers. Financial and non‑financial  performance are considerations for  short‑term variable remuneration  (STVR) outcomes. Leadership and  strategy outcomes also determine  whether long‑term alignment  remuneration (LTAR) awards are  granted and, consistent with new  APRA requirements, final vesting  outcomes, a change to our executive  remuneration framework implemented  from this year.   Additional detail on our performance  outcomes can be found on page 23. C ultur e, accountabilit y and  remuneration Our remuneration framework, including  consequences for when expectations  are not met, supports the Group’s  commitment to do the right thing for  our customers, people, communities,  and shareholders.FY23 outcomes are inclusive of STVR  risk adjustments applied to three Executives, including roles not defined as Key Management Personnel (KMP), applying the risk and reputation modifier. Two Executives received a downward adjustment to their STVR as a result of risk related matters and one received an upward adjustment for risk and reputation considerations. Risk management is a core element  of our approach to performance, from setting expectations to assessing outcomes. Our people understand the importance of managing risk to deliver better outcomes for customers. Over time the proportion of our people fully meeting the Group’s risk expectations has improved. This reflects the impact of our programs of work aimed at improving risk management, together with the impact of consequences when expectations are not met. It is encouraging to see more of our  people also being recognised for  managing risk well.   Additional detail on consequences and  remuneration adjustments can be found  on page 18. Performance and  remuneration outcomes The Board considered performance  outcomes both in the context of FY23  and over a multi‑year period  and approved: • In the 2023 financial year, fixed remuneration remained unchanged for eight of the 10 Executive KMP,including the Chief Executive Officer(CEO).
