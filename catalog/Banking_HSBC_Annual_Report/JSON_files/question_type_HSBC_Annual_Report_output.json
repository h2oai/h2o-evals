This is because the risk assessment helps the auditors to focus their efforts on the areas of highest risk and design procedures that are tailored to the specific risks facing the group and industry, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting material misstatements, including those that may arise from fraud or error.

The audit team set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of the audit and the nature, timing, and extent of their audit procedures on individual financial statement line items and disclosures.

The level of estimation uncertainty and judgement has remained high during 2023 due to the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, persistently high levels of inflation in some territories, and the rising global interest rate environment, as well as developments in mainland China's commercial real estate sector and economy more broadly. These uncertainties have resulted in certain limitations in the reliability of the modelling methodologies used to estimate ECL, which do not incorporate all factors that are relevant to estimating ECL, such as the differentiated impact of economic conditions on certain industry sectors. As a result, management judgemental adjustments are made, which are inherently judgemental and subject to estimation uncertainty. The severity of economic scenarios, and their related probability weightings, across territories, significant assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flow projections for defaulted exposures in relation to the mainland China commercial real estate portfolio, assumptions made in determining judgemental management adjustments, and the disclosures made in relation to ECL, were all discussed with the Group Audit Committee. The audit assessed the design and effectiveness of governance and controls over the estimation of ECL, including the observation of management\u2019s review and challenge in governance forums for the determination of economic scenarios and their probability weightings, and the assessment of ECL for Retail and Wholesale portfolios, including the assessment of management judgemental adjustments. The audit also tested controls over model validation and monitoring, the identification of credit impaired triggers, the input of critical data into source systems and the flow and transformation of critical data from source systems to impairment models and management judgemental adjustments, the calculation and approval of management judgemental adjustments to modelled outcomes, and approval of significant individual impairments."

Based on this evaluation, the auditor concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements was appropriate, but noted that this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. The auditor also read the other information in the Annual Report and considered whether it was materially inconsistent with the financial statements or their knowledge obtained in the audit, but had no reporting obligations in relation to the other information."

This, in turn, can contribute to HSBC Holdings plc's overall strategy of expanding its wealth and unsecured lending business in the region, as outlined in the company's annual report and accounts for 2023."

They also used a benchmark of total assets, as the parent company's primary purpose was to act as a holding parent company with investments in the group's subsidiaries, not to generate operating profits. To evaluate the effect of misstatements, they used performance materiality, which was set at 75% of overall materiality, and determined sample sizes for testing account balances, classes of transactions, and disclosures. They also obtained audit evidence from work that is scoped and provided by other auditors that are engaged by third parties, such as a report evidencing the testing of external systems and controls supporting HSBC's payroll and HR processes."
