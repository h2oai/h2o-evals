# Sample Questions

#### Sample Multi choice questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the purpose of a consequence/probability matrix in risk management?

**Answer:** ['To assess the likelihood and potential impact of a risk event', 'To identify and prioritize potential risks', 'To evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies', 'To determine the level of risk tolerance for an organization']

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the main responsibility of the Risk Management Directorate in the Argentina Customs?

**Answer:** The main responsibility of the Risk Management Directorate is to create strategic politics for the Customs control, to collect and analyze the information to define the risk profiles, and to coordinate the activities in which the Customs General Directorate has to act with other organizations.

#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the purpose of a risk register in risk management?

**Answer:** A risk register is an essential documentation tool for risk management, which serves as an "index" of an administration's risks and helps in developing respective risk plans for each functional area.

**Token Presence:** ['risk', 'register', 'risk management', 'index', 'administration', 'risks', 'risk plans', 'functional area']
