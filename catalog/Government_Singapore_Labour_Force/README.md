# Sample Questions

#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the main focus of the report on the Labour Force in Singapore 2022?

**Answer:** The main focus of the report is to provide a comprehensive review of the performance of the resident population in Singapore's labour market, with a focus on the continued recovery of the resident labour force from the impact of the pandemic and an assessment of patterns of improvement in relation to longer-term structural trends.

**Token Presence:** ['comprehensive', 'review', 'performance', 'resident', 'labour', 'market', 'recovery', 'patterns', 'improvement', 'structural', 'trends']

#### Sample Multi choice questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the reason for the slight decrease in labour force participation rate in 2022?

**Answer:** ['The decrease in demand for temporary pandemic-related roles.', 'The increase in the employment rate of seniors aged 65 and over.', 'The decrease in the employment rate of youths aged 15-24.', 'The increase in the number of residents aged 25 to 64 in education or training.']
