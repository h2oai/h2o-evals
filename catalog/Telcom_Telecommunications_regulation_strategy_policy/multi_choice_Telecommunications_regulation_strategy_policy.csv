No longer are networks carrying switched voice signals but conveying a variety of voice and data services using Internet Protocols (IP), with many operators sharing the same core infrastructure for their fixed and mobile offerings. Furthermore, mobile operators convey their services using different technologies simultaneously (e.g. GSM, 3G and LTE). Cost concepts and methodologies: Depending on the precise purpose of the analysis, a range of different cost concepts may be applied, e.g.: • Fully Allocated Costs (FAC) • Long Run Incremental Costs  (LRIC) • Pure Long Run Incremental Costing (Pure LRIC) • Stand Alone Costs (SAC) • Marginal Costs (MC) Whereas FAC models calculate average service costs by distributing costs over services based on cost allocation keys, the LRIC concept focuses on the additional costs caused by a given service (or set of services), thereby acting as a proxy for marginal cost.Cost modelling4 Cost modelling is central to large parts of regulatory scrutiny in the telecoms sector. Due to the high proportion of fixed costs and the large extent to which network elements are shared between different services, the calculation of service costs in telecoms requires sophisticated cost models.In recent years many regulators have started to follow the guidelines set by the European Commission (EC) by mandating pure LRIC for some wholesale services such as termination. Under Pure LRIC, common costs are not to be recovered through the service being costed. The SAC concept looks at the costs of  producing a given service in isolation from others (i.e. without the economies of scope (or synergies) arising from the provision of several telecoms services). Finally, MC focus on the cost of  producing an extra unit (e.g. minutes) of a given service. Different cost concepts are used for  different purposes: • Statutory accounts are based on  FAC. • Incremental costs (LRIC) are used for regulatory and commercial purposes as well as in the context of competition policy issues. • Marginal Costs (MC) are particularly relevant in the context of short term pricing strategy and competition analysis. • SAC represent an upper boundary in the context of price regulation. PwC 7Cost models Two major types of cost models may  be used in the calculation of telecoms service costs: 1. Top Down models which are  typically based on historical  accounting data from the general ledger. 2.

Over time, most regulators in developed markets have steered away from retail price regulation and, instead, have focused on seeking to ensure a level playing ﬁeld in the wholesale markets – leaving retail markets to competitive forces. Price cap regulation In the absence of effective  competition, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) take direct action to regulate both end-user and network prices to prevent exploitation of dominance. In the majority of cases, this has  been performed through the establishment of a price control regime which limits the price changes permitted on baskets of services using a pricing formula such as ‘RPI – X’, where prices are permitted to increase by the rate of inflation less an ‘X-Factor’ calculated to ensure that perceived inefficiencies are removed over time. Price cap regimes limit the increase  of the average price of a given set of services (or, in fact, prescribe a decrease). This method has the advantage of combining two desirable features, namely: • A certain extent of pricing  ﬂexibility that enables the regulated entity to compete eﬀectively; and • Incentives to operate as eﬃciently as possible (when price increases are limited, extra proﬁt can be generated from cost reductions).18 Telecommunications regulationOften set in a multiyear period, this  has the advantage of removing the requirement to review prices on an annual basis, but increases the risk of applying an inappropriate cap. This issue has historically been one faced by fixed operators, but the current mobile call termination rate debate has brought it to the centre of MNOs’ board agendas.  It is imperative for operators and  regulators to fully engage in this process and to undertake their own modelling in order to contribute to the debate on the basis of an informed position. Safeguard caps Safeguard caps (e.g. a price limit on a particular service) tend to be used in situations where a retail market is considered as competitive on a forward looking basis but where there is a perceived risk that an operator may enjoy or abuse market power at some point in time (e.g. due to the prospect of a privatisation or sale to a strategic partner – which may significantly affect an operator’s market position). Typically, safeguard caps are set at levels that are currently non-binding.  Safeguard caps can also be  formulated with the help of a formula (e.g. falling over time, or placing a limit on the ratio of two prices (e.g. on-net and off-net prices), etc.).  Retail pricing strategy and competition policy PwC have advised fixed and mobile operators across the globe on retail pricing strategy. Successful retail (and wholesale) pricing strategies need to be checked against regulatory constraints including provisions against anticompetitive behaviour. We assist operators in maximising  their commercial and strategic potential under the constraint of retail price regulation. PwC 19 Key topic areas include: • Impact of unbalanced tariffs and low fixed line  penetration: the relationship between price controls  and tariff rebalancing is a central conflict facing many NRAs especially where unbalanced tariffs and relatively low fixed line penetration prevail. • Determining levels of X, duration of controls,  number and definition of baskets: it is imperative  that operators fully understand the implications of  possible regulatory outcomes and fully engage n  the regulatory process, in order to influence  decisions. • High levels of fixed cost: the telecoms industry is  characterised by high levels of fixed cost and capital expenditure – increasing the sensitivity of financial performance to price cap levels.20 Telecommunications regulationSeparation support10 Separation of integrated businesses is a regulatory tool  aimed at: • Increasing transparency. • Identifying cross subsidies. • Facilitating scrutiny from a competition policy perspective.• Ensuring non-discrimination (e.g. between a downstream business unit and its competitors)",What are the key topic areas for telecommunications regulation?,"['Impact of unbalanced tariffs and low fixed line penetration, determining levels of X, duration of controls, number and definition of baskets, and separation support.', 'Retail pricing strategy and competition policy, safeguard caps, and ensuring non-discrimination.', 'Price cap regulation, high levels of fixed cost, and increasing transparency.', 'Identifying cross subsidies, facilitating scrutiny from a competition policy perspective, and rebalancing tariffs.']",0,Telecommunications_regulation_strategy_policy.pdf

Safeguard caps can also be  formulated with the help of a formula (e.g. falling over time, or placing a limit on the ratio of two prices (e.g. on-net and off-net prices), etc.).

PwC 21 Accounting separation is the  most common remedy imposed by regulators when the existing regulatory remedies do not provide the necessary transparency. The main benefit for our clients of  developing separated accounts is effective regulatory compliance. However, clients are increasingly taking advantage of these accounts for commercial benefits including: • Use of costing information to  determine product, customer and channel profitability. • Defend market position and as leverage during regulatory negotiation. • Revision of the transfer charging arrangements between business units.The costs of implementing separation tend to be very significant but depend on the form of separation and on the boundaries chosen. We advise operators and regulators on the form of separation most suitable to the situation at hand, and on the implementation of the recommended form of separation. PwC brings together unrivalled  levels of expertise in telecoms sector, particularly in wholesale functions, operations, organisation design, transactions, costing models, demand forecasting and technical network assessment.22 Telecommunications regulationRegulatory accounting11 PwC provides expert advice  to operators and regulators on regulatory accounting. The main areas include: • Service Costing (FAC, LRIC, etc.) • Production of regulatory accounts •  Regulatory Reporting and  Accounting Separation •  Asset valuations  – Historical Cost Accounting  (HCA)  – Current Cost Accounting  (CCA)  –Index based valuation  – Market price based valuation  – Modern Equivalent Asset –(MEA) valuationWe have the breadth and depth  of expertise to advice on both the design of regulatory accounting frameworks and the implementation of regulatory accounting systems in a range of suitable software options. This includes the design and negotiation of valuation methodologies as well as the implementation of asset valuations. In many cases an asset revaluation  has to be preceded by a review or reconstruction of the Fixed Asset Register (FAR). In a world of falling technology  prices and rising costs of labour and land, valuations often have a signiﬁcant impact on regulated companies’ allowed proﬁts, service costs, interconnection rates and therefore the bottom line of company results (hence market prices). We also advise on diﬀerent  accounting conventions, in particular Operating Capital Maintenance (OCM) and Financial Capital Maintenance (FCM). The latter diﬀers from OCM in that it includes the eﬀect of holding gains (or losses) in the Proﬁt and Loss (P&L) account.

These range from Universal Service Obligations (USO) on the incumbent (or another) operator to tender processes under which operators compete for subsidies that are offered for the provision of a given set of services to areas that are not commercially viable. Traditionally, incumbent fixed line  operators with a Universal Service Obligation are required to install and operate lines across the country at uniform prices to the consumer. This ignores the fact that some customers, particularly in rural areas, may be very expensive to connect.  The imposition of USO generally  entails the creation of a compensation mechanism and the estimation of the costs of this obligation. These models have to take into account the costs of having the USO but also any indirect benefits that may stem from it (e.g. brand value, ubiquity, etc.). For mobile operators, uncertainty  over the cost of incremental fixed access leads to the fundamental question of whether it is more cost effective to contribute to a Universal Service Fund (USF) or to participate in the delivery of Universal Service Targets (UST).The accurate estimation of the cost of universal service by an independent party is critical to incumbent and competitor alike: the incumbent’s perception that excessive cost disadvantages the providing operator is balanced by competitors’ perceptions of any Universal Service Fund as a stealth tax.

In many cases part of the spectrum that was initially allocated to government can be reallocated. Frequently, benefits can be achieved by reallocating spectrum in such a way that frequencies are freed up for new technologies and for usages that result in maximum benefit and welfare generation. Over the last few years, increasing  use has been made of market based mechanisms in the allocation of scarce spectrum. Market based allocation mechanism include various types of auctions and spectrum trading. An efficient spectrum policy also  requires a streamlined and effective spectrum allocation mechanism in line with international best practice.Spectrum policy14 Spectrum constitutes a  scarce resource.
