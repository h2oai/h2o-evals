# Sample Questions

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** Is a grant by a private foundation to a Section 509(a)(1), (2), or (3) organization considered an act of self-dealing merely because one of the organization's officers, directors, or trustees is also a manager of or a substantial contributor to the private foundation?

**Answer:** No, a grant by a private foundation to a Section 509(a)(1), (2), or (3) organization will not be considered an act of self-dealing merely because one of the organization's officers, directors, or trustees is also a manager of or a substantial contributor to the private foundation.

#### Sample Multi choice questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the difference between discrete and continuing transactions for the purpose of examination techniques?

**Answer:** ['Discrete transactions are single events, while continuing transactions are ongoing.', 'Discrete transactions are ongoing, while continuing transactions are single events.', 'Discrete transactions involve multiple events, while continuing transactions involve a single event.', 'Discrete transactions involve a single event, while continuing transactions involve multiple events.']
