Additionally, PwC evaluated management's assessment of the forecast cash flows from the five-year business plan and long-term growth rates used in estimating recoverable amounts as part of impairment assessments of investments in subsidiaries, goodwill, and intangible assets.

These uncertainties have resulted in certain limitations in the reliability of the modelling methodologies used to estimate ECL, which do not incorporate all factors that are relevant to estimating ECL, such as the differentiated impact of economic conditions on certain industry sectors. As a result, management judgemental adjustments are made, which are inherently judgemental and subject to estimation uncertainty. The severity of economic scenarios, and their related probability weightings, across territories, significant assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flow projections for defaulted exposures in relation to the mainland China commercial real estate portfolio, assumptions made in determining judgemental management adjustments, and the disclosures made in relation to ECL, were all discussed with the Group Audit Committee.

The auditor assessed the appropriateness of these assumptions by testing controls in place over significant assumptions, assessing the appropriateness of the methodology used, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. The auditor also challenged the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and evaluated whether the judgments made in determining these assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias. Additionally, the auditor obtained evidence to corroborate and challenge the data supporting significant assumptions, including past experience, external market information, third-party sources, and historical publicly available financial information from BoCom. The auditor also determined a reasonable range for the discount rate assumption with the assistance of valuation experts and compared it to the discount rate used by management."
