# Sample Questions

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What are the challenges faced by low-income taxpayers, those with limited mobility or limited English proficiency, and those who do not have flexible schedules when it comes to tax compliance?

**Answer:** Low levels of service and limited customer service options are especially challenging for these groups, contributing to tax compliance issues and loss of trust in the tax system.
