The GRA is replenished through transfers from the Investment Account (IA), which invests resources transferred from the GRA to broaden the IMF's income base. The IA comprises two subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount. The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred from the GRA that are not related to profits from gold sales and aims to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) terms in excess of the three-month SDR interest rate over time while minimizing the frequency and extent of negative returns and underperformance over an investment horizon of three to four years. The Endowment Subaccount was credited with SDR 4.1 billion in financial year ended April 30, 2022. The IMF's Executive Board conducts periodic reviews of the Fixed-Income Subaccount's investment strategy to ensure that it achieves returns that exceed the SDR interest rate by a margin of 50 basis points over time."
