This model does not interfere with the constitutionally required general proportionality and can be achieved without significant changes to the existing legislation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the minimalist model aligns with the principles of equality, non-discrimination, and human dignity as encapsulated in the Constitution of RSA, which is also reflected in the White Paper on Marriages and the Official Identity Management (OIM) Policy.

The implications of the minimalist model on the development of a new single legislation on marriages in SA may include the inclusion of provisions that protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, religious, or cultural persuasions, and the establishment of a fair and transparent system for the appointment of marriage officers."
