Explorers, on the other hand, work in a more random manner and do not know what they are looking for at the outset of the analysis. They require a more flexible and adaptive approach to data analysis, which may involve using techniques such as data mining or machine learning to discover patterns and relationships in large datasets. This has implications for IT architecture and data management, as it requires a more sophisticated and flexible infrastructure to support the needs of explorers. The use of ODS can help to address these needs by providing a consolidated view of current data that can be easily accessed and analyzed, but the IT architecture must also be designed to accommodate the more random and unpredictable nature of exploratory analysis."
