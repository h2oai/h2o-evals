In an emergency situation, whe n  immediate services are required to alleviate or prevent severe pain, disability, or death,  and the patient lacks capacity to give consent for the services required, the physician  recommending treatment to the patient must follow Hospital policies and pro cedures  regarding obtaining consent from a properly designated representative, such as a  surrogate, or providing treatment pursuant to the emergency exception if applicable.   Except in an emergency situation as defined above, proper informed consent is a  prerequisite to any procedure or treatment that is considered complex based on medical  judgment, and includes, but is not limited to the following situations:     1. Operative procedures   2. Invasive procedures that have the potential for serious risks and adverse reactions   3. Blood transfusions or other use of blood products   4. Planned use of moderate sedation   5. Electroconvulsive therapy     The informed consent discussion should include at least information about the specific  procedure or treatment, the reasonably foreseeabl e risks and benefits of the treatment,  and the reasonable alternatives for care and treatment.  Further information on what is  required in the discussion and what must be documented is found in the Administrative  Manual Policy  Informed Consent .      In all s urgical procedures, the physician in whose name the permission for the operation  is obtained must participate in person or as a member of the operating team and must be  present during the critical portion(s) of the procedure.  Such participation may not be   delegated without the informed consent of the patient or the patient’s properly designated  representative.     B. Disclosure of Unanticipated Outcomes and Medical Errors     1) Definitions :    a) Adverse Event: A detrimental effect  from a diagnostic test, defect, failure and/or  error within the healthcare system, medical treatment or surgical intervention     b) Unanticipated Outcome: A result that differs significantly from the anticipated  result of a treatment or procedure    6   2) Disclosure     The attending physician responsib le for the patient’s care, or his/her designee as  appointed by the Chief of Staff, will serve as the primary communicator of an  unanticipated outcome or adverse event to the patient and/or family/legal guardian.   The person designated as the primary commun icator with the patient/family must  document in the progress notes of the patient’s medical record what was  communicated to the patient/family and any response or other discussion.       C. Sterilization     Sterilization procedures are to be performed only in ac cordance with applicable federal  and State law, and must adhere to the procedures outlined in the SHC Informed Consent  for Sterilization or Hysterectomy policy.  Physicians planning to perform sterilization  procedures must carefully reference these require ments and should seek advice from  Risk Management to ensure that all elements of the consent process are met whenever  there are any concerns about the consent process.       4. RESEARCH     A. Any research project conducted in the Hospital or Clinics involving hu man subjects must  be approved by the Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research (the  Investigational Review Board or “IRB”) of Stanford University School of Medicine.       B",What is an unanticipated outcome?,"['A result that is not desired by the patient or healthcare provider.', 'A result that differs significantly from the anticipated result of a treatment or procedure.', 'A result that is not life-threatening or does not require additional medical intervention.', 'A result that is not caused by a medical error or defect.']",1,Stanford_Healthcare_Regulations.pdf
"4. RESEARCH     A. Any research project conducted in the Hospital or Clinics involving hu man subjects must  be approved by the Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research (the  Investigational Review Board or “IRB”) of Stanford University School of Medicine.       B. The Medical Staff Member who is participating as a Principal Investigator in a research  protocol involving human subjects is responsible for submitting the research protocol for  approval to the IRB of Stanford University School of Medicine and complying with all IRB  requirements relating to the provision of care and  treatment of a patient under an  approved research protocol.     C. All research projects must be conducted in accordance with the Medical Staff   Policy on Clinical Research, and any applicable SHC policy.  Confidentiality is maintained  in accordance with SHC HIPAA Research policy.     D. If there is uncertainty as to whether a proposed plan of care should be designated as  research (vs. “innovative care”), the SUMC Innovative Care Guidelines should be  consulted.       5. PATIENT ASSESSMENT     A. H&P Requirements  (Must be documented by a member of the SHC medical staff,  housestaff , or an Advanced Practice Provider  with the appropriate privileges.)     1. A history and physical examination (H&P) must be completed no more than 30  days before or 24 hours after inpatient or outpatient admission. If the H&P was  completed within 30 days before admission, an updated examination , also known  as an H&P Interval, must be completed and documented within 24 hours after  admission.     2. The H&P must be completed for every patient prior to surgery, or a procedure  requiring anesthesia services, except in emergencies.  In all cases, except for  emergencies, the H&P and/or H&P Interval must be completed and documented  before the surgery or procedure takes place, even if that surgery occurs le ss than  24 hours after admission or registration.    7   3. The History and Physical will include, at minimum, the following components and  any other information deemed to be relevant by the examining provider:     • Chief Complaint   • History of Present Illness   • Medications and Medication Allergies   • Review of Systems   • Physical Examination   • Assessment Including Provisional Diagnosis   • Treatment Plan     4. The H&P Interval  will indicate that the H&P was reviewed, the patient was  examined, any changes that have occurred, o r that “no changes” have occurred in  the patient’s condition. In the case of a surgical update, it will also confirm that  indications for the procedure are still present.     5. In addition to the H&P requirements above, patients undergoing sedation or  anest hesia care must also have a Pre -Anesthesia Assessment.  The assessment  is performed and documented prior to the induction of sedation/anesthesia and  considers data from other assessments.     6.  The H&P requirement does not apply for Emergency Surgery; howev er, an H&P  must be documented as soon as possible after surgery.       6. PLANNING CARE, TREATMENT AND SERVICES     A. Orders     All orders for treatment must be in writing or entered into the electronic medical record,  dated and timed.  Orders written by an individual who is not a medical staff member,  housestaff  member, or Advanced Practice Provider  (NP or PA) authorized to enter orders  must be cosigned by the supervising physician prior to implementation.       B. Verbal/Telephone Orders     Verbal/telephone orders may be issued by members of the medical staff, housestaff , or  Advanced Practice P rovider s authorized to write orders to license d nursing personnel  (RN’s) and registered pharmacists.  Verbal/telephone orders appropriate to their  discipline may be given to any licensed physical therapist, occupational therapist,  speech -language pathologist, registered laboratory technologist, regist ered MRI  technologist, registered nuclear medicine technologist, registered sonographer,  registered x -ray technologist, or dietician.      Verbal/telephone orders may be issued only if the circumstances are such that an  immediate order is required,  and it wo uld be impractical for the prescriber issuing the  order to do so in writing  or to directly enter the order into the electronic medical record .    1) Verbal/telephone orders are appropriate in the following situations:     a.

In all cases, except for  emergencies, the H&P and/or H&P Interval must be completed and documented  before the surgery or procedure takes place, even if that surgery occurs le ss than  24 hours after admission or registration.    7   3. The History and Physical will include, at minimum, the following components and  any other information deemed to be relevant by the examining provider:     • Chief Complaint   • History of Present Illness   • Medications and Medication Allergies   • Review of Systems   • Physical Examination   • Assessment Including Provisional Diagnosis   • Treatment Plan     4. The H&P Interval  will indicate that the H&P was reviewed, the patient was  examined, any changes that have occurred, o r that “no changes” have occurred in  the patient’s condition. In the case of a surgical update, it will also confirm that  indications for the procedure are still present.     5. In addition to the H&P requirements above, patients undergoing sedation or  anest hesia care must also have a Pre -Anesthesia Assessment.  The assessment  is performed and documented prior to the induction of sedation/anesthesia and  considers data from other assessments.     6.  The H&P requirement does not apply for Emergency Surgery; howev er, an H&P  must be documented as soon as possible after surgery.       6. PLANNING CARE, TREATMENT AND SERVICES     A. Orders     All orders for treatment must be in writing or entered into the electronic medical record,  dated and timed.  Orders written by an individual who is not a medical staff member,  housestaff  member, or Advanced Practice Provider  (NP or PA) authorized to enter orders  must be cosigned by the supervising physician prior to implementation.       B. Verbal/Telephone Orders     Verbal/telephone orders may be issued by members of the medical staff, housestaff , or  Advanced Practice P rovider s authorized to write orders to license d nursing personnel  (RN’s) and registered pharmacists.  Verbal/telephone orders appropriate to their  discipline may be given to any licensed physical therapist, occupational therapist,  speech -language pathologist, registered laboratory technologist, regist ered MRI  technologist, registered nuclear medicine technologist, registered sonographer,  registered x -ray technologist, or dietician.      Verbal/telephone orders may be issued only if the circumstances are such that an  immediate order is required,  and it wo uld be impractical for the prescriber issuing the  order to do so in writing  or to directly enter the order into the electronic medical record .    1) Verbal/telephone orders are appropriate in the following situations:     a.

"4. RESEARCH     A. Any research project conducted in the Hospital or Clinics involving hu man subjects must  be approved by the Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research (the  Investigational Review Board or “IRB”) of Stanford University School of Medicine.       B. The Medical Staff Member who is participating as a Principal Investigator in a research  protocol involving human subjects is responsible for submitting the research protocol for  approval to the IRB of Stanford University School of Medicine and complying with all IRB  requirements relating to the provision of care and  treatment of a patient under an  approved research protocol.     C. All research projects must be conducted in accordance with the Medical Staff   Policy on Clinical Research, and any applicable SHC policy.  Confidentiality is maintained  in accordance with SHC HIPAA Research policy.     D. If there is uncertainty as to whether a proposed plan of care should be designated as  research (vs. “innovative care”), the SUMC Innovative Care Guidelines should be  consulted.       5. PATIENT ASSESSMENT     A. H&P Requirements  (Must be documented by a member of the SHC medical staff,  housestaff , or an Advanced Practice Provider  with the appropriate privileges.)     1. A history and physical examination (H&P) must be completed no more than 30  days before or 24 hours after inpatient or outpatient admission. If the H&P was  completed within 30 days before admission, an updated examination , also known  as an H&P Interval, must be completed and documented within 24 hours after  admission.     2. The H&P must be completed for every patient prior to surgery, or a procedure  requiring anesthesia services, except in emergencies.  In all cases, except for  emergencies, the H&P and/or H&P Interval must be completed and documented  before the surgery or procedure takes place, even if that surgery occurs le ss than  24 hours after admission or registration.    7   3. The History and Physical will include, at minimum, the following components and  any other information deemed to be relevant by the examining provider:     • Chief Complaint   • History of Present Illness   • Medications and Medication Allergies   • Review of Systems   • Physical Examination   • Assessment Including Provisional Diagnosis   • Treatment Plan     4. The H&P Interval  will indicate that the H&P was reviewed, the patient was  examined, any changes that have occurred, o r that “no changes” have occurred in  the patient’s condition. In the case of a surgical update, it will also confirm that  indications for the procedure are still present.     5. In addition to the H&P requirements above, patients undergoing sedation or  anest hesia care must also have a Pre -Anesthesia Assessment.  The assessment  is performed and documented prior to the induction of sedation/anesthesia and  considers data from other assessments.     6.  The H&P requirement does not apply for Emergency Surgery; howev er, an H&P  must be documented as soon as possible after surgery.       6. PLANNING CARE, TREATMENT AND SERVICES     A.

Suicidal Patient     For the protection of patients, the Medical and Nursing Staf fs, and SHC, the following  standards are to be met in the care of the patient who is determined to be potentially  suicidal:     1) Psychiatric consultation must be obtained immediately (or as soon as the patient’s  condition permits if the suicide attempt has ren dered him/her unconscious) after a  patient has threatened suicide or made a suicide attempt.      2) Prior to the consultation, the physician in charge of the care should evaluate the type  of immediate care the patient requires and write the appropriate orders which might  include one or more of the  orders described in the SHC “Emotionally  Distressed/Suicidal/Alcohol and/or Substance Abuse Patient Plan of Care” policy.     3) If a patient’s medical history or symptoms suggest a problem with alcohol and/or  other drugs, the attending physician is encouraged to seek information and/or  consultation regarding alcohol and drug treatment services to assist with  detoxification, referral to community resources or treatment sources, and other  support.      C. Restraints and Seclusio n   14   A restraint or seclusion may only be used if needed to improve the patient’s well -being or  to protect the safety of other persons, and less restrictive interventions have been  determined to be ineffective.     A member of the medical staff, housestaff, or  an Advanced Practice Provider  with the  appropriate privileges may order restraints.       The order for restraint or seclusion must comply with the medical staff approved Hospital  policy on restraints and seclusion.  Standards for restraint and seclusion ca re exist in the  SHC policy for Restraint and Seclusion.  Seclusion may only be used in the psychiatry  unit and the Emergency Department.     The use of restraints and seclusion to manage violent or self -destructive behavior  requires the practitioner to evalua te the individual in person within one hour  of restraint or  seclusion application.     The use of restraints for safety concerns in the delivery of the patient’s medical -surgical  care (i.e. for non -violent patients or patients who are not self -destructive) re quires a  physician , APP,  or LIP order prior to application of restraints.  If a physician , APP, or LIP  is unavailable, and an RN who has successfully demonstrated competence in  assessment for restraint has applied restraints for patient protection, a verba l or written  order must be placed within 12 hours of the application of the restraint.  The patient must  be examined by a physician within 24 hours of the initiation of the restraint, and a written  order entered into the medical record.     Hospital policy s pecifies the time within which an order must be obtained after each use  of restraint or seclusion and the maximum time for the use of either intervention. PRN  orders are not allowed.  Restraints are time -limited to no more than one calendar day or  24 hours  from the original order. The physician , APP, or LIP must do a face -to-face  examination of the patient and renew the order at least once each calendar day or 24- hour period from when the order was initiated that the restraint is required.     D. Organ and Tissue Donation     Members of the Medical Staff are expected to follow the SHC Organ and Tissue Donation  for Brain Dead Patients Policy and the Organ Donation after Cardiac Death Policy. These  policies state that the California Tissue Donation Network is to be contacted for  assessment and potential discussion of donation with the patient’s family at or near the  time of imminent brain death.

Autopsies are performed by the SHC Pathology Department. The Medical Staff, and  specifically the attending phy sician, should be notified of the time and place an  autopsy is  performed. The complete post -mortem report should be made part of the medical record  within three (3) months.     B. Suicidal Patient     For the protection of patients, the Medical and Nursing Staf fs, and SHC, the following  standards are to be met in the care of the patient who is determined to be potentially  suicidal:     1) Psychiatric consultation must be obtained immediately (or as soon as the patient’s  condition permits if the suicide attempt has ren dered him/her unconscious) after a  patient has threatened suicide or made a suicide attempt.      2) Prior to the consultation, the physician in charge of the care should evaluate the type  of immediate care the patient requires and write the appropriate orders which might  include one or more of the  orders described in the SHC “Emotionally  Distressed/Suicidal/Alcohol and/or Substance Abuse Patient Plan of Care” policy.     3) If a patient’s medical history or symptoms suggest a problem with alcohol and/or  other drugs, the attending physician is encouraged to seek information and/or  consultation regarding alcohol and drug treatment services to assist with  detoxification, referral to community resources or treatment sources, and other  support.      C. Restraints and Seclusio n   14   A restraint or seclusion may only be used if needed to improve the patient’s well -being or  to protect the safety of other persons, and less restrictive interventions have been  determined to be ineffective.     A member of the medical staff, housestaff, or  an Advanced Practice Provider  with the  appropriate privileges may order restraints.       The order for restraint or seclusion must comply with the medical staff approved Hospital  policy on restraints and seclusion.  Standards for restraint and seclusion ca re exist in the  SHC policy for Restraint and Seclusion.  Seclusion may only be used in the psychiatry  unit and the Emergency Department.     The use of restraints and seclusion to manage violent or self -destructive behavior  requires the practitioner to evalua te the individual in person within one hour  of restraint or  seclusion application.     The use of restraints for safety concerns in the delivery of the patient’s medical -surgical  care (i.e. for non -violent patients or patients who are not self -destructive) re quires a  physician , APP,  or LIP order prior to application of restraints.  If a physician , APP, or LIP  is unavailable, and an RN who has successfully demonstrated competence in  assessment for restraint has applied restraints for patient protection, a verba l or written  order must be placed within 12 hours of the application of the restraint.  The patient must  be examined by a physician within 24 hours of the initiation of the restraint, and a written  order entered into the medical record.     Hospital policy s pecifies the time within which an order must be obtained after each use  of restraint or seclusion and the maximum time for the use of either intervention. PRN  orders are not allowed.  Restraints are time -limited to no more than one calendar day or  24 hours  from the original order. The physician , APP, or LIP must do a face -to-face  examination of the patient and renew the order at least once each calendar day or 24- hour period from when the order was initiated that the restraint is required.

In all cases, the final authority in the chain  of command on patient care decisions rests with the C hief of Staff or the Chief of Staff designee.        15. SUPERVISION OF HOUSESTAFF     All members of the Housestaff are under the supervision of the Medical Staff.  Members of the  Medical Staff exercise that supervision under the guidelines established by the Gr aduate Medical  Education Program.  Medical Staff members who serve as housestaff supervisors must be  licensed independent practitioners, and must hold clinical privileges that reflect the patient care,  treatment, and service responsibilities given to the h ousestaff.   Housestaff, who are approved to  provide patient care, treatment, and services, may write orders unless otherwise specified in the  Bylaws, Medical Staff Rules and Regulations, or Service requirements.  However, supervising  members of the Medica l Staff are responsible for the patient care, treatment, services, safety and  quality, and documentation activities of the residents they supervise.  The Graduate Medical  Education Committee must provide regular reports of the activities of the Graduate Me dical  Education Program to the Medical Executive Committee, which will communicate this report to  the SHC Board of Directors.      16   16.
