The ability to adjust prices and affect business costs quickly in response to external labor market conditions is illustrated by the series of foreign worker levy rebates that were rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic. The management of the EP qualifying salary, which is meant to maintain the quality of EP holders to be comparable to the upper one-third of resident workers in the same skill category, is also part of this broader immigration policy. By managing the qualifying salary, the government can ensure that foreign professionals, managers, and executives are attracted to work in Singapore while also protecting the resident labor force. The various criteria governing the issuance of the EP, such as the requirement for employers to demonstrate that they have fairly considered residents for the role, also help to protect the resident labor force."

The Foreign Maid Scheme allows for the hiring of domestic workers from regional countries beyond Malaysia to provide live-in domestic help and ensure affordable child care and elder care to encourage female residents to enter the labor force. This helps to manage the short-term flow of labor by providing a source of foreign workers to meet the demand for domestic help, which can fluctuate based on economic conditions. The EP issuance criteria, on the other hand, is used to manage the quality of foreign professionals, managers, and executives who are allowed to work in Singapore. The policy objective for managing the EP qualifying salary is to maintain the quality of EP holders to be comparable to the upper one-third of resident workers in the same skill category. This helps to ensure that foreign workers are not brought in at the expense of resident workers, and that the resident labor force is protected. Both of these measures are used in conjunction with the dependency ratio ceiling to achieve longer-term policy aims and manage the short-term flow of labor in response to economic cycles and other events."

                        "The rapid population growth in Singapore during the period of 1824 to 1931 was fueled by large-scale immigration, primarily from China and India, which was encouraged by the British colonial government to provide labor for the trading port, public works, and plantations. The immigration policies during that time did not impose any restrictions on female migrants, resulting in a significant increase in the female population and a preferential status for women under immigration policy. This led to a dramatic increase in the number of women of child-bearing age and a decrease in the overall sex ratio, contributing to natural increase becoming the major source of population growth in the post-war period. The high fertility rates during the post-war baby boom also contributed to natural increase, and by the first post-independence Census in 1970, natural increase accounted for 94.8 percent of intercensal population growth from 1957 to 1971."
