Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) and ISAs are further  described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

In addition to forming this opinion, in this report we have also provided  information on how we approached the audit, how it changed from the previous year and details of the significant discussions that we had  with the GAC. Key audit matters –Expected credit losses - Impairment of loans and advances (group) –Impairment of investment in associate - Bank of Communications Co., Ltd (‘BoCom‘) (group) –Investments in subsidiaries (parent company) –Valuation of defined benefit pension obligations (group) Materiality –Overall group materiality: US$1.6bn (2022: US$1bn) based on 5% of profit before tax adjusted for notable items. –Overall parent company materiality: US$1.5bn (2022: US$950m) based on 0.75% of total assets. This would result in an overall materiality of  US$2.1bn and was therefore reduced below the group materiality. –Performance materiality: US$1.2bn (2022: US$750m) (group) and US$1.1bn (2022: US$712m) (parent company). The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial  statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud)  identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit;  and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were  addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a  separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Held for sale accounting (group), which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because the risk has reduced following the  completion of the sale of the retail banking operations in France. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year",What is the basis for the auditors' opinion?,"['ISAs (UK) and ISAs.', ""FRC's Ethical Standard and IESBA Code."", 'International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.', 'Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.']",0,HSBC_Annual_Report.pdf

HSBC Holdings plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023 319 Financial statementsExpected credit losses – Impairment of loans and advances (group) Nature of the key audit matter Determining expected credit losses (‘ECL’) involves management judgement and is subject to a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Management makes various assumptions when estimating ECL. The significant assumptions that we focused on in our audit included those with  greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on ECL. These included assumptions made in  determining economic scenarios and their probability weightings (specifically the central and downside scenarios given these have the most material  impact on ECL) and estimating discounted cash flows for material credit impaired exposures in relation to the mainland China commercial real estate  portfolio.  The level of estimation uncertainty and judgement has remained high during 2023 as a result of the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and  geopolitical environment, persistently high levels of inflation in some territories and the rising global interest rate environment, as well as  developments in mainland China’s commercial real estate sector and economy more broadly. Macroeconomic conditions vary between territories and industries, leading to uncertainty around judgements made in determining the severity and  probability weighting of economic scenarios used in ECL models. The modelling methodologies used to estimate ECL are developed using historical experience. The impact of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions  has resulted in certain limitations in the reliability of these methodologies to forecast the extent and timing of future customer defaults and therefore  estimate ECL. In addition, modelling methodologies do not incorporate all factors that are relevant to estimating ECL, such as the differentiated impact  of economic conditions on certain industry sectors. These limitations are addressed with management judgemental adjustments, the measurement of  which is inherently judgemental and subject to estimation uncertainty. Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee We held discussions with the GAC covering governance and controls over ECL, with a significant focus on the uncertain prevailing macroeconomic  conditions and developments in mainland China’s commercial real estate sector. We discussed a number of areas, including: –the severity of economic scenarios, and their related probability weightings, across territories; –significant assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flow projections for defaulted exposures in relation to the mainland China commercial  real estate portfolio;  –assumptions made in determining judgemental management adjustments; and –the disclosures made in relation to ECL. How our audit addressed our key audit matter We assessed the design and effectiveness of governance and controls over the estimation of ECL. We observed management’s review and challenge  in governance forums for (1) the determination of economic scenarios and their probability weightings, and (2) the assessment of ECL for Retail and  Wholesale portfolios, including the assessment of management judgemental adjustments. We also tested controls over: –model validation and monitoring; –the identification of credit impaired triggers; –the input of critical data into source systems and the flow and transformation of critical data from source systems to impairment models and  management judgemental adjustments; –the calculation and approval of management judgemental adjustments to modelled outcomes; and –approval of significant individual impairments. We involved our economic experts in assessing the significant assumptions made in determining the severity and probability weighting of economic  scenarios.

Group-wide audit approach HSBC has entity level controls that have a pervasive influence across the group, as well as other global and regional governance and controls  over aspects of financial reporting, such as those operated by the Global Risk function for expected credit losses. A significant amount of IT and  operational processes and controls relevant to financial reporting are undertaken in operations centres run by Digital Business Services (‘DBS‘).  Whilst these operations centres are not separate components, the IT and operational processes and controls are relevant to the financial  information of the Significant Subsidiaries. Financial reporting processes and controls are also performed centrally in HSBC‘s Group Finance  function and finance operation centres (‘Finance Operations’), including the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, held for  sale classifications and the consolidation of the group‘s results, the preparation of financial statements, and management‘s oversight controls  relevant to the group‘s financial reporting. Group-wide processes or processes in DBS and Finance Operations are subject to specified audit procedures or an audit over specific FSLIs.  These procedures primarily relate to testing of IT general controls, IT dependencies, forward looking economic scenarios for ECL, operating  expenses, intangible assets, valuation of financial instruments, existence testing of financial instruments, intercompany eliminations,  reconciliations and consolidation as well as payroll. For these areas, we either performed audit work ourselves, or directed and provided  oversight of the audit work performed by PwC teams in the UK, Poland, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India, Mexico and the Philippines. Some of  this work was relied upon by the PwC teams auditing the Significant Subsidiaries. This audit work, together with analytical review procedures  and assessing the outcome of local external audits, also mitigated the risk of material misstatement for balances in entities that were not part of  a Significant Subsidiary. HSBC Holdings plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023 323 Financial statementsSignificant Subsidiaries audit approach In March 2023, we held a meeting in Hong Kong with the partners and senior staff from the group audit team and certain PwC teams who  undertake audits of the Significant Subsidiaries and the operations centres. The meeting focused primarily on our approach to auditing HSBC’s  businesses, changes at HSBC and in our PwC teams, and how we continue to innovate and improve the quality of the audit with a focus on  technology and our global delivery model. We also discussed our significant audit risks. We asked the partners and teams reporting to us on the Significant Subsidiaries to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size of the  operations they audited. The overall materiality levels ranged from US$107m to US$1.0bn. Certain Significant Subsidiaries were audited to a  local statutory audit materiality that was a lower level than our allocated group materiality. We designed global audit approaches for the products and services that substantially make up HSBC's global businesses, such as lending,  deposits and derivatives. These approaches were provided to the partners and teams performing audit testing for the Significant Subsidiaries. We were in active dialogue throughout the year with the component auditors of the Significant Subsidiaries, including consideration of how they  planned and performed their work. Senior members of our team undertook at least one in-person site visit where a full scope audit was  requested and we had oversight over certain areas of audit work performed. We attended Audit Committee meetings for some of the  Significant Subsidiaries. We also attended meetings with management for each of these Significant Subsidiaries at the year end",What was the scope of the audit opinions obtained for HSBC UK Bank plc and HSBC Bank Canada?,"['Full scope audit opinions for both HSBC UK Bank plc and HSBC Bank Canada.', 'Audit opinions over specific balances for both HSBC UK Bank plc and HSBC Bank Canada.', 'Full scope audit opinions for HSBC UK Bank plc only.', 'Audit opinions over specific balances for HSBC Bank Canada only.']",2,HSBC_Annual_Report.pdf

Financial reporting processes and controls are also performed centrally in HSBC‘s Group Finance  function and finance operation centres (‘Finance Operations’), including the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, held for  sale classifications and the consolidation of the group‘s results, the preparation of financial statements, and management‘s oversight controls  relevant to the group‘s financial reporting. Group-wide processes or processes in DBS and Finance Operations are subject to specified audit procedures or an audit over specific FSLIs.  These procedures primarily relate to testing of IT general controls, IT dependencies, forward looking economic scenarios for ECL, operating  expenses, intangible assets, valuation of financial instruments, existence testing of financial instruments, intercompany eliminations,  reconciliations and consolidation as well as payroll. For these areas, we either performed audit work ourselves, or directed and provided  oversight of the audit work performed by PwC teams in the UK, Poland, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India, Mexico and the Philippines.

HSBC Holdings plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023 323 Financial statementsSignificant Subsidiaries audit approach In March 2023, we held a meeting in Hong Kong with the partners and senior staff from the group audit team and certain PwC teams who  undertake audits of the Significant Subsidiaries and the operations centres. The meeting focused primarily on our approach to auditing HSBC’s  businesses, changes at HSBC and in our PwC teams, and how we continue to innovate and improve the quality of the audit with a focus on  technology and our global delivery model. We also discussed our significant audit risks. We asked the partners and teams reporting to us on the Significant Subsidiaries to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size of the  operations they audited. The overall materiality levels ranged from US$107m to US$1.0bn. Certain Significant Subsidiaries were audited to a  local statutory audit materiality that was a lower level than our allocated group materiality. We designed global audit approaches for the products and services that substantially make up HSBC's global businesses, such as lending,  deposits and derivatives. These approaches were provided to the partners and teams performing audit testing for the Significant Subsidiaries. We were in active dialogue throughout the year with the component auditors of the Significant Subsidiaries, including consideration of how they  planned and performed their work. Senior members of our team undertook at least one in-person site visit where a full scope audit was  requested and we had oversight over certain areas of audit work performed.

We attended Audit Committee meetings for some of the  Significant Subsidiaries. We also attended meetings with management for each of these Significant Subsidiaries at the year end. The audit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in Hong Kong relied upon work performed by other teams in Hong Kong  and the PwC network firms in India, mainland China and Singapore. Similarly, the audit of HSBC Bank plc in the UK relied upon work performed  by other teams in the UK and the PwC network firms in France and Germany. We considered how the audit partners and teams for the  Significant Subsidiaries instructed and provided oversight to the work performed in these locations. Collectively, Significant Subsidiaries covered  83% of total assets and 74% of total operating income. Using the work of others We have continued our use of evidence provided by others through our reliance on management assurance testing of certain controls across  the group. This included testing of controls performed by management themselves in certain low risk areas including reconciliations and  footnote disclosure controls. We re-performed a portion of the testing to ensure appropriate quality of testing, as well as assessing the  competence and objectivity of those performing the testing. We also used the work of PwC experts, for example economic experts for our work around the severity and probability weighting of  macroeconomics variables as part of the expected credit loss allowance and actuaries on the estimates used in determining pension liabilities.  An increasing number of controls are operated on behalf of HSBC by third parties. We obtained audit evidence from work that is scoped and  provided by other auditors that are engaged by those third parties. For example, we obtained a report evidencing the testing of external systems  and controls supporting HSBC's payroll and HR processes. Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together  with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the  individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the  financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Financial statements – group Financial statements – parent company Overall materiality US$1.6bn (2022: US$1bn). US$1.5bn (2022: US$950m). How we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for notable items (2022:  adjusted profit before tax).0.75% of total assets. This would result in an overall  materiality of US$2.1bn and was therefore reduced below  the group materiality. Rationale for benchmark  appliedWe believe a standard benchmark of 5% of profit before  tax adjusted for notable items is an appropriate quantitative  indicator of materiality, although certain items could also be  material for qualitative reasons. This benchmark is  consistent with our approach for listed entities.A benchmark of total assets has been used, as the parent  company‘ s primary purpose is to act as a holding parent  company with investments in the group ‘s subsidiaries, not  to generate operating profits and therefore a profit based  measure is not relevant.    We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected  misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature  and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our  performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to US$1.2bn (2022: US$750m) for the group financial  statements and US$1.1bn (2022: US$712m) for the parent company financial statements",What was the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole for the group?,"['US$1.6bn', 'US$2.1bn', 'US$1.2bn', 'US$750m']",0,HSBC_Annual_Report.pdf

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected  misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature  and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our  performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to US$1.2bn (2022: US$750m) for the group financial  statements and US$1.1bn (2022: US$712m) for the parent company financial statements",How did the team assess the competence and objectivity of those performing testing?,"['By relying on management assurance testing of certain controls across the group.', 'By re-performing a portion of the testing to ensure appropriate quality of testing.', 'By assessing the competence and objectivity of those performing the testing.', 'By obtaining audit evidence from work that is scoped and provided by other auditors that are engaged by third parties.']",2,HSBC_Annual_Report.pdf
"Senior members of our team undertook at least one in-person site visit where a full scope audit was  requested and we had oversight over certain areas of audit work performed. We attended Audit Committee meetings for some of the  Significant Subsidiaries. We also attended meetings with management for each of these Significant Subsidiaries at the year end. The audit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in Hong Kong relied upon work performed by other teams in Hong Kong  and the PwC network firms in India, mainland China and Singapore. Similarly, the audit of HSBC Bank plc in the UK relied upon work performed  by other teams in the UK and the PwC network firms in France and Germany. We considered how the audit partners and teams for the  Significant Subsidiaries instructed and provided oversight to the work performed in these locations. Collectively, Significant Subsidiaries covered  83% of total assets and 74% of total operating income. Using the work of others We have continued our use of evidence provided by others through our reliance on management assurance testing of certain controls across  the group. This included testing of controls performed by management themselves in certain low risk areas including reconciliations and  footnote disclosure controls. We re-performed a portion of the testing to ensure appropriate quality of testing, as well as assessing the  competence and objectivity of those performing the testing. We also used the work of PwC experts, for example economic experts for our work around the severity and probability weighting of  macroeconomics variables as part of the expected credit loss allowance and actuaries on the estimates used in determining pension liabilities.  An increasing number of controls are operated on behalf of HSBC by third parties. We obtained audit evidence from work that is scoped and  provided by other auditors that are engaged by those third parties. For example, we obtained a report evidencing the testing of external systems  and controls supporting HSBC's payroll and HR processes. Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together  with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the  individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the  financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Financial statements – group Financial statements – parent company Overall materiality US$1.6bn (2022: US$1bn). US$1.5bn (2022: US$950m). How we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for notable items (2022:  adjusted profit before tax).0.75% of total assets. This would result in an overall  materiality of US$2.1bn and was therefore reduced below  the group materiality.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.  The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,  accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to  conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on  the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of  detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related  to breaches of financial crime laws and regulations and regulatory compliance, including regulatory reporting requirements and conduct of  business, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered  those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax legislation.  We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override  of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries in relation to cost targets, and  management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they  could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work",What is the basis of accounting used in the financial statements?,"['Going concern basis', 'Cash basis', 'Accrual basis', 'Tax basis']",0,HSBC_Annual_Report.pdf
"In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate  governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: –The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the  information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and parent company's position, performance, business model and strategy; –The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and –The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the GAC. We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance  with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the  auditors. Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in  accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such  internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors  either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but  is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities,  outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with  laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a  material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment  by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques.
