This Policy is the foundation for all information security activities. It focuses not only on the technology for the storage,  processing, and transmission of information, but also on administrative and operational practices for the protection of all  information, data, files, and processing resources owned by <Organization> . It is the intent of this Policy to facilitate the exchange of information and computing resources while balancing the need for  protecting information with the cost of implementation. This Policy is the property of <Organization> . It is intended for distribution to all employees and users of information systems  at <Organization>  locations. Scope of the Policy  This Policy applies to all employees, vendors, contractors, and consultants, who create, distribute, access, or manage  information by means of <Organization> ’s information technology systems including personal or corporate computers,  networks, and communication services by which they are connected. It equally applies to individuals and enterprises, who by  nature of their relationship to <Organization> , are entrusted with confidential or sensitive information. This Policy addresses all aspects of information security and continuity from initial design of a system through implementation  and operation. It also addresses any device used to store, process, or communicate <Organization>  proprietary or other  protected information. Definitions Information Owner  – Information Owners are the managers who bear responsibility for the acquisition, development, and  maintenance of applications that process <Organization>  information. All application and company information must have a  designated Information Owner. For each type of information, Information Owners designate the relevant sensitivity classification,  designate the appropriate level of criticality, define which users will be granted access, and approve requests for various ways  in which the information will be utilized. Custodians  –  Custodians are in physical or logical possession of either <Organization>  information or information that  has been entrusted to <Organization> . While System Administrators are Custodians, whenever information is maintained  only on a personal computer, the User is also a Custodian.

Security Monitoring and Enforcement It is the responsibility of the Security Officer to implement appropriate measures to detect attempts to compromise the security  or integrity of information or information technology systems. When implementing monitoring capabilities, consideration should  be given as to what situations are to be monitored based on the extent of risk, the most effective means for monitoring security  activities, the resources available for monitoring, and system constraints that limit the ability to monitor security events. If  appropriate measures are not available within a system environment to effectively monitor security events, additional controls  to mitigate security risks should be implemented. When activity occurs that is in conflict with security policies and standards, Head of Business Units should take the appropriate  steps to enforce desired security practices. The steps involved range from training of the Users, revoking access, altering  security parameters and possibly disciplinary actions.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the security of remote working and mobile device use by employees  of <Organization> . Remote Information Processing refers to performing information processing activities in a remote location other than a  <Organization>  controlled facility. It includes the following sites: • fixed locations (such as a residence) • mobile locations (such as a hotel or airport) • third-party locations (such as manufacturing partners, test facilities or contractor agencies) Scope of the Policy  This policy applies to all client name employees,  temporary  staff, contractors  and partners  (“employees”).  All employees  are  personally responsible for ensuring that they comply with this policy, and failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. The policy applies to all mobile computing devices, whether personally owned or issued by <Organization> . This includes, but  is not limited to smartphones, tablets, laptops and removable media devices. Responsibility for Policy Implementation The <Organization>  Security  Officer or other authorized  representative  shall be responsible  for ensuring  implementation  of all  items listed in the Policy Requirements  section. Responsibility  for the creation  and implementation  of specific procedures  may  be assigned to internal staff or contractors as appropriate. Policy Requirements The <Organization>  Security  Officer or other authorized  representative  shall ensure compliance  with the following  standards: Mobility  Theft Prevention <Organization>  Users are required to implement company-approved measures to prevent the theft of <Organization>  owned/ leased desktop and mobile computing devices Types of Mobile Devices Mobile computing devices include any computing device or media that is easily transportable outside of <Organization>  premises, such as but not limited to the following: • laptop computers • USB mass storage devices • mobile phones • external hard drives • optical media (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)3Accidental loss or theft incurs numerous hard and soft costs including the following: • replacement cost of hardware • re-licensing of software (operating systems/applications) • incident reporting • lost productivity • exposure of proprietary information, perhaps to competitors • exposure of sensitive employee information • exposure of sensitive or confidential customer information • potential federal, state and local fines associated with exposure of confidential employee or customer information • damage to the reputation, brand, and market share of <Organization> • misuse of <Organization>  resources (for example, to commit a crime or harass  <Organization>  Users/customers) • risk to <Organization>  networks due to access to remote dialup scripts, email addresses, and passwords Mobile Phones  Definitions Mobile Phones  – Any portable  phone device (smart or otherwise)  that, in addition to having the capability  to make and receive  phone calls, is also capable  of receiving,  transmitting  and/or storing confidential  information.
