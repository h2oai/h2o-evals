If the taxpayer is filing Form 1040-SR, they can use the Standard Deduction Chart on the last page of the form to calculate their standard deduction in most situations. However, if the taxpayer or their spouse (if filing jointly) can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return, they must check the appropriate box in the Standard Deduction section. Additionally, if the taxpayer or their spouse were born before January 2, 1959, or were blind at the end of 2023, they must check the appropriate boxes on the line labeled 'Age/Blindness.' If the taxpayer's spouse died in 2023, certain rules apply regarding their eligibility for the standard deduction. Taxpayers who were born before January 2, 1959, and died in 2023, are considered to reach age 65 on the day before their 65th birthday. If a taxpayer is preparing a return for someone who died in 2023, they should see Pub. 501 for more information before completing the standard deduction information. Furthermore, if a taxpayer wasn't totally blind as of December 31, 2023, they must get a statement certified by their eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) that states their vision cannot be improved beyond 20/200 in their better eye with glasses or contact lenses, or their field of vision is 20 degrees or less. The statement must be kept for their records. If a taxpayer receives a notice or letter and prefers it in Braille or large print, they can use Form 9000 to request notices in an alternative format. Married taxpayers filing separately whose spouse itemizes deductions on their return must check the 'Spouse itemizes on a separate return or you were a dual-status alien' box. If a taxpayer's spouse was born before January 2, 1959, or was blind at the end of 2023, and had no income, is not filing a return, and cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's return, the taxpayer can check the appropriate boxes on the line labeled 'Age/Blindness' if they are filing separately and their spouse is not filing a return. Taxpayers can visit IRS.gov for more information or forms."

If you haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax return at least once for tax years 2020, 2021, or 2022, it has expired and must be renewed if you need to file a federal tax return. You don't need to renew your ITIN if you don't need to file a federal tax return. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again unless you haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax return at least once for tax years 2020, 2021, or 2022. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS office or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and want all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it are at IRS.gov/ITIN.

Presidential Election Campaign Fund This fund helps pay for Presidential election campaigns. The fund reduces candidates' dependence on large contributions from individuals and groups and places candidates on an equal financial footing in the general election. The fund also helps pay for pediatric medical research. If you want $3 to go to this fund, check the box. If you are filing a joint return, your spouse can also have $3 go to the fund. If you check a box, your tax or refund won't change."
