Electronic mail (email) is a highly efficient form of modern communication media.  Used appropriately, email provides people with a means to communicate thereby  facilitating business contact. However, this convenience also tempts users to  experiment or take  advantage of this media, resulting in email of unwelcome  types (collectively known along with other unwelcome activity as Net Abuse). The  improper use of this email technology may jeopardize systems integrity, security  and service levels. Access to email is provided to users to assist them to perform  their work and their use of email must not jeopardize operation of the system or  the reputation and/or integrity of the State.     2. Email accounts are made available to all agency staff that require the service  for  the performance of job related functions. The following statements apply:   (A) All email and associated system resources are the property of the State.  Email is  subject to the same restrictions on its use and the same review  process as is any  other gov ernment furnished resource provided for the use  of employees.  Its use  and content may be monitored.   (B) Email usage must be able to withstand public scrutiny.  Users must comply  with all applicable legislation, regulations, policies and standards.    This   includes  complying with copyright and license provisions with respect to  both programs  and data.   (C) While email is provided as a business tool to users, its reasonable,  incidental use  for personal purposes is acceptable.  This use must not,  however, detrimentally  affect employee productivity, disrupt the system  and/or harm the government's  reputation.   3. Users may not:   (A) use email for commercial solicitation or for conducting or pursuing  their  own business interests or those of another organization,  Information Security Policies,  Procedures, Guidelines     Revised December  2017  Page 23 of 94  (B) use email to distribute hoaxes, chain letters   or advertisements  and/or  send rude, obscene, threatening or harassing messages,   (C) use email to distribute pornographic material or hate literature,   (D) use email to harass other staff members,   (E) use email to send executable programs or games,   (F) use email to send potentially offensive material, and   (G) propagate viruses knowingly or maliciously.   4. Users must not send, forward and/or reply to large distribution lists concerning  non-government business.   In addition, users must consider the impact on the   network when creating and using large, work -related distribution lists.   5. Email is a record and therefore management of email must comply with existing   legislation, regulations, policies and s tandards.   6. Alleged inappropriate use of the email technology will be reviewed by the agency   involved as well as the hosting agency on a case by case basis and may lead to   disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. In respect to contractors, it may  lead to cancellation of the contractual arrangement.   In any of the cases, it may   lead to litigation .    5.5      INTERNET/INTRANET SECURITY     1.

The specific security threats to Web servers generally fall into one of the following  categories:   (A) Malicious entities may exploit software bugs in the Web server,  underlying  operating system or active content to gain unauthorized  access to the Web  server.   Examples of unauthorized access are gaining  access to files or folders  that were not meant to be publicly accessible or  executing privileged commands  and/or installing software on the Web  server.   (B) Denial of Service attacks may be directed to the Web server denying valid  users  an ability to use the Web server for the duration of the attack.   (C) Sensitive information on the Web server may be distributed to  unauthorized  individuals.   (D) Sensitive information that is not encrypted when transmitted between the  Web server and the browser may be intercepted.

(H) The server may be used as a distribution point for illegal copies software  attack  tools, or pornography, perhaps making the organization liable for  damages.     4. The hosting agency is responsible for the Web server. Some examples of controls  to protect from unauthorized access or modification are:   (A) install or enable only necessary services,   (B) install Web content on a dedicated hard drive or logical partition,   (C) limit uploads to directories that are not readable by the Web server,   (D) define a single directory for all external scripts or programs executed as  part of  Web content,   (E) disable the use of hard or sym bolic links,   (F) define a complete Web content access matrix that identifies which folders  and files within the Web server document directory are restricted and  which are  accessible (and by whom), and   (G) use host -based intrusion detection systems and/or file integrity  checkers to  detect intrusions and verify Web content.     5. Maintaining a secure Web server is the responsibility of the hosting agency and  involves the following steps:   (A) configuring, protecting and analyzing log files,   (B) backing up critical information frequently,   (C) maintaining a protected authoritative copy of the organization's Web  content,   (D) establishing and following procedures for recovering from compromise,   (E) testing and applying patches in a timely manner, and   (F) testin g security periodically.     6.

Maintaining a secure Web server is the responsibility of the hosting agency and  involves the following steps:   (A) configuring, protecting and analyzing log files,   (B) backing up critical information frequently,   (C) maintaining a protected authoritative copy of the organization's Web  content,   (D) establishing and following procedures for recovering from compromise,   (E) testing and applying patches in a timely manner, and   (F) testin g security periodically.     6. A firewall environment must be employed to perform the following general  functions:   (A) filter packets and protocols,   (B) perform inspection of connections,   (C) perform proxy operations or selected applications,   (D) monitor traffic allowed or denied by the firewall, and   (E) provide authentication to users using a form of authentication that does not  rely on static, reusable passwords that can be sniffed.     7. The hosting agency responsible for Internet security will:   (A) Keep operational systems and applications software up to date.     Because  software systems are so complex, it is common for security - related problems to  be discovered only after the software has been in  widespread use",What is the purpose of a Web content access matrix?,"['To restrict access to specific folders and files within the Web server document directory.', 'To define a single directory for all external scripts or programs executed as part of Web content.', 'To disable the use of hard or symbolic links.', 'To host illegal copies of software, attack tools, or pornography.']",0,Information_Security_Policy.pdf

(F) Report activity monthly to each State Agency involved.     6.3 VOICE MAIL SECURITY     1. The voice mail feature of many PBXs can be a particularly vulnerable feature. This  is because voice mail is typically used to let someone store voice messages at a  central location by calling in from any inside or outside line and then retrieve the  messages from any inside or outside line. It also grants the general public access  to the PBX  system.     2. In retrieving messages, the target extension and a password are usually required to  gain access to the messages. Since the target extension is usually easy to  determine, the only significant restriction to an adversary is the password.  Once an adversary determines a target user's password all messages left for the  target user are accessible to the adversary. The adversary could also delete Information Security Policies,  Procedures, Guidelines     Revised December  2017  Page 28 of 94  messages from the target user's mailb ox to prevent an important message from  getting to the target user. Some guidelines to secure the contents of voice mail  include the following:   (A) Default and obvious passwords must be changed at initial log -in.   The  target  user's extension is easily known.    Default passwords   established at system  initialization time may never have been changed.    Fixed length passwords are more vulnerable than variable length  passwords.  Variable length passwords can be terminated by a special key  such as the # or *  key.  If not, the passwords would probably be of fixed  length and it reduces the number of random combinations that may be  tried before a correct password is found.   (B) Non-terminated password entry should be avoided.   Some systems  accept a  continuous str ing of digits, granting entry when the correct  password sequence is  entered.   By not requiring a password entry to be  terminated, the length of the  average sequence needed to guess a four - digit password is reduced by a factor  of five.   (C) A complete password must be entered before an incorrect password is  rejected.   If it is rejected on the first incorrect digit, sequential guessing  becomes much  more practical.  For example, on such a system that has a  fixed password length  of four and uses the digits  0-9, it would take at most  40 sequential attempts to  guess a password. On a system that required all  four digits to be entered at most  10,000 guesses would be required.   (D) Disallow access to external lines via the Voice Mail system.

Information Security Policies,  Procedures, Guidelines     Revised December  2017  Page 30 of 94  3. Hosting agencies should have a goal of achieving 99.9%+ of the metrics  established in the service level agreement. Failure to achieve these targets could  be an indication of security breaches.     4. Insofar as incidents are concerned, both offensive and defensive actions to protect  the security of physical assets should be considered routine. Examples of offensive  actions include:   (A) routine changes of passwords,   (B) develop an  escalation procedure of incidents,   (C) routine changes of locks or combinations to the facilities,   (D) have more than one person knowledgeable for critical functions,   (E) rotate shifts or people between functions,   (F) monitor all incursion attempts,   (G) install latest versions of firewall software,   (H) maintain 24x7 vendor contact list,   (I) routine backups,   (J) off-site storage of system information and programs,   (K) redundant components, lines for critical systems, and   (L) testing of recovery procedures.     5. Examples of defensive actions include:   (A) report and action all deviations to security policies, procedures, guidelines  and best practices,   (B) shut down any infected machine immediately,   (C) disconnect any problem areas from the network,   (D) revoke privileges of users violating policies,   (E) assign severity to an issue and escalate, and   (F) acquire knowledgeable resources.     7.3      BACK -UP OF INFORMATION     1. Back -up copies of essential business information and software must be taken  regularly.

"7.3      BACK -UP OF INFORMATION     1. Back -up copies of essential business information and software must be taken  regularly. Adequate backup facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential  business information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media  failure. Back up arrangements for individual systems should be regularly tested to  ensure that they meet the requirements of business continuity plans. The following  controls must be considered:   (A) A minimum level of back -up information, together with accurate and  complete  records of the back -up copies and documented restoration  procedures, should  be stored in a remote location at a sufficient distance  to escape any damage  from a disaster at the main site. At least three  generations or cycles of back -up information should be retained for  important business applications.   (B) Back -up information should b e given an appropriate level of physical  and environmental protection consistent with the standards applied at the  main site.   The controls applied to media at the main site should be  extended to cover the  back-up site.   (C) Back -up media should be regularly tested, where practicable, to ensure that Information Security Policies,  Procedures, Guidelines     Revised December  2017  Page 31 of 94  they can be relied upon for emergency use when necessary.   (D) Restoration procedures should be regularly checked and tested to ensure  that they are effective and that they can be completed within the time  allotted in the  operational procedures for recovery.   (E) The retention period for essential business information and also any  requirement  for archive copies to be permanently retained should be  determined.     7.4 ACCESS CONTROL     1. Logical and physical access controls are required to ensure the integrity of  the information and physical assets.     2. The following guidelines for controlling logical access should be implemented  by all state hosting agencies:   (A) document and adhere to procedures for granting, modifying and revoking  access,   (B) ensure segregation of duties for access   (C) install detection mechanisms for unauthorized access attempts,   (D) timeout a session after 15 minutes of inactivity, and   (E) revoke access after an inactivity period of 60 days.     3. Physical access control guidelines for all agencies include:   (A) all telecommunication and computer related equipment are to be in a  secured,  locked environment,   (B) access codes for secure environments must be changed at least every 60  days or in the event of a n individual departing that previously had access,   (C) account for all keys issued for those facilities using this method and  replace  locking mechanism when a key is missing,   (D) when the system permits, log all accesses and retain, and   (E) secure all peripherals such as air conditioning, generators, etc.   (F) segregation of duties must be implemented to prevent unauthorized access  to systems or data     7.5 NETWORK     1. Unsecured connections to network services can affect the whole organization.  Users must only have direct access to the services that they have been specifically  authorized to use. This control is particularly important for network connections  to sensitive or critical business applications or to users in high -risk locations, e.g.  public or external areas that are outside the organization's security management  and control.   2. Procedures concerning the use of networks and network services should cover:   (A) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed,   (B) authorization  procedures for determining who  is allowed to access  which  networks and networked services, and   (C) management controls   and   procedures  to   protect  the  access  to   Information Security Policies,  Procedures, Guidelines     Revised December  2017  Page 32 of 94  network  connections and network services.     3. The path from the user terminal to the computer service must be controlled.  Networks are designed to allow maximum scope for a sharing of resources  and flexibility of routing.
