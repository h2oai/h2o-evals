The Group's ESG obligations and ambitions were prioritized, and progress was made towards achievement of gender diversity goals, with high levels of employee engagement. The Group's corporate reputation was the highest among its peers, and financial and non-financial performance were considerations for STVR outcomes. Leadership and strategy outcomes determined whether LTAR awards were granted, and risk management was a core element of the approach to performance, with consequences for when expectations were not met. Over time, the proportion of people fully meeting the Group's risk expectations improved, reflecting the impact of programs of work aimed at improving risk management. The Board considered performance outcomes both in the context of FY23 and over a multi-year period and approved fixed remuneration, STVR outcomes between 73% and 100% of maximum, and LTAR grant with no reduction."
