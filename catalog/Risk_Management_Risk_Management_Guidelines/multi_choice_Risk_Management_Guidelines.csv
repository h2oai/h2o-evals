On the  other hand, risks assumed have the potential to wipe out  expected returns and may result into losses to the institutions.  These losses could be either expected or unexpected. Expected  losses are those that an instit ution knows with reasonable  certainty will occur (e.g. the expected default rate of loan  portfolio) and are typically reserved for in some manner.  Unexpected losses are those associated with unforeseen events (e.g. losses due to a sudden downturn in economy, falling interest rates, natural disaster s, or human action such as  terrorism). Institutions rely on their capital as a buffer to absorb  such losses.    1.1.2 Due to this fact, the need for effective risk management  framework in institutions cannot be over emphasized. Through  effective risk management framework, institutions will be able to  optimize their risk-return trade off.     1.2  Objectives and Risk Descriptions    1.2.1  Objectives   1.2.1.1 Bank of Tanzania (BOT) has legitimate interest in ensuring that  institutions operate in a safe and sound manner.

"The RMGs are based on  international best practices in risk management. All institutions  are therefore required to observe these guidelines in the course  of conducting their businesses.     1.2.1.3. Issuance of RMGs is also in line with BOT’s intention of becoming  increasingly risk-focused in conducting onsite examinations and  offsite surveillance. In conducting risk focused supervision, rating of an institution’s performance will take into account, among other factors, its risk management framework and ability to  manage risks. Institutions are therefore, expected to become  more risk-focused and their internal audit function should be risk- focused in order to ensure robustness, efficiency and  effectiveness of risk management systems and practices.    Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions, 2010  6  1.2.2 Risk Description    1.2.2.1 These guidelines cover six most common risks in banking i.e.  credit, liquidity, market, operational, strategic and compliance  risks. Description of these risks is as follows:    (a) Credit Risk:  Credit risk arises from the potential that an  obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its  ability to perform such obligation is impaired resulting in  economic loss to the institution.    (b) Liquidity Risk:  Liquidity risk is the potential for loss to an  institution arising from either its inability to meet its obligations  as they fall due or to fund  increases in assets without  incurring unacceptable cost or losses. Liquidity risk includes  inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk also arises from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that  affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal  loss in value.   (c)  Market Risk:   Market risk is the risk of losses in on and off  balance sheet positions as a result of adverse changes in  market prices i.e. interest rates, foreign exchange rates,  equity prices and commodity prices. Market risk exists in  both trading and banking book. A trading book consists of positions in financial instruments and commodities held  either with trading intent or in order to hedge other elements  of the trading book.    (d) Operational Risk:  Operational risk is the current and  prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from  inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems  or from external events.

Risk Management entails four key processes:    1.4.2 Risk Identification:  In order to manage risks, an institution must  identify existing risks or risks that may arise from both existing and  new business initiatives for example, risks inherent in lending  activity include credit, liquidity, interest rate and operational risks.  Risk identification should be a continuing process, and should  occur at both the transaction and portfolio level.    1.4.3 Risk Measurement:  Once risks have been identified, they should  be measured in order to determine their impact on the  institution’s profitability and capital. This can be done using various techniques ranging from simple to sophisticated models. Accurate and timely measurement of  risk is essential to effective  risk management systems. An institution that does not have a risk  measurement system has limited ability to control or monitor risk  levels. An institution should periodically test to make sure that the  measurement tools it uses are a ccurate. Good risk measurement  systems assess the risks of both individual transactions and  portfolios.     Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions, 2010  81.4.4 Risk Control:  After measuring risk, an institution should establish  and communicate risk limits through policies, standards, and  procedures that define responsibility and authority. Institutions may also apply various mitigating tools in minimizing exposure to  various risks. Institutions shou ld have a process to authorize  exceptions or changes to risk limits when warranted.   1.4.5 Risk Monitoring:  Institutions should put in place an effective  management information system (MIS) to monitor risk levels and  facilitate timely review of risk positions and exceptions.  Monitoring reports should be frequent, timely, accurate, and  informative and should be distributed to appropriate individuals  to ensure action, when needed.    1.5  Risk Management Framework    1.5.1 A risk management framework encompasses the scope of risks to  be managed, the process/systems and procedures to manage those risks and the roles and responsi bilities of individuals involved  in risk management. The framework should be comprehensive  enough to capture all risks an institution is exposed to and have flexibility to accommodate any change in business activities. Key elements of an effective risk management framework are:    (a) active board and senior management oversight;     (b) adequate policies, procedures and limits;     (c) adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management  information systems; and    (d) comprehensive internal controls.      1.5.2  Active Board and Senior Management Oversight    1.5.2.1 Boards of directors have ultimate responsibility for the level of risk  taken by their institutions. Accordingly, they should approve the  overall business strategies and significant policies of their  institutions, including those related to managing and taking risks, and should also ensure that seni or management is fully capable  of managing the activities that their institutions conduct.  While  all boards of directors are responsible for understanding the  nature of the risks significant to their institutions and for ensuring  that management is taking the steps necessary to identify,  measure, monitor, and control these risks, the level of technical  knowledge required of directors may vary depending on the  particular circumstances at the institution.

"Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions, 2010  91.5.2.2 Directors should have a clear understanding of the types of risks  to which their institutions are exposed and should receive reports  that identify the size and significance of the risks in terms that are meaningful to them.  In addition, directors should take steps to develop an appropriate understanding of the risks their  institutions face, possibly through briefings from auditors and  experts external to the institution.  Using this knowledge and information, directors should provide clear guidance regarding the level of exposures acceptable to their institutions and have  the responsibility to ensure th at senior management implements  the procedures and controls necessary to comply with adopted  policies.      1.5.2.3 Senior management is responsi ble for implementing  strategies in  a manner that limits risks associated with each strategy and that  ensures compliance with laws and regulations on both a long- term and day-to-day basis.  Accordingly, management should  be fully involved in the activities of their institutions and possess sufficient knowledge of all major business lines to ensure that  appropriate policies, controls, and risk monitoring systems are in  place and that accountability and lines of authority are clearly delineated. Senior management is also responsible for establishing and communicating a strong awareness of and  need for effective internal controls and high ethical standards.   Meeting these responsibilities requires senior managers of an  institution to have a thorough understanding of banking and  financial market activities an d detailed knowledge of the  activities their institution conducts, including the nature of  internal controls necessary to limit the related risks.                                1.5.3  Adequate Policies, Procedures and Limits    1.5.3.1 An institution's directors and senior management should tailor  their risk management policies and procedures to the types of  risks that arise from the activities the institution conducts.  Once  the risks are properly identified, the institution's policies and its  more fully articulated procedures provide detailed guidance for  the day-to-day implementation of broad business strategies, and  generally include limits designed to shield the institution from  excessive and imprudent risks.  While all institutions should have policies and procedures that address their significant activities and risks, management is expect ed to ensure that they are  modified when necessary to resp ond to significant changes in  the institution's activities or business conditions.    1.5.3.2 To ensure that, an institution's policies, procedures, and limits are  adequate, the same should at minimum address the following:     Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions, 2010  10(i) policies, procedures, and limits should provide for  adequate identification, measurement, monitoring, and  control of the risks posed by its significant activities;    (ii) policies, procedures, and limits should be consistent with  complexity and size of the business, the institution's stated  goals and objectives, and the overall financial strength of the institution;    (iii) policies should clearly delineate accountability and lines  of authority across the institution's activities; and    (iv) policies should provide for the review of activities new to  the institution to ensure that the infrastructures necessary  to identify, monitor, and control risks associated with an  activity are in place before the activity is initiated.     1.5.4 Adequate Risk Measuremen t, Monitoring and Management   Information Systems   1.5.4.1 Effective risk monitoring requires institutions to identify and  measure all material risk exposures. Consequently, risk monitoring  activities must be supported by information systems that provide  senior managers and directors with timely reports on the financial  condition, operating performance, and risk exposure of the  institution, as well as with regular and sufficiently detailed reports for line managers engaged in the day-to-day management of  the institution's activities.    1.5.4.2 Institutions should have risk monitoring and management  information systems in place that provide directors and senior  management with a clear understanding of the institution's  positions and risk exposures.     1.5.4",What should directors of financial institutions have a clear understanding of?,"['The size and significance of risks to which their institutions are exposed.', 'The types of risks to which their institutions are exposed.', 'The infrastructures necessary to identify, monitor, and control risks associated with new activities.', 'The nature of internal controls necessary to limit the related risks.']",1,Risk_Management_Guidelines.pdf

Since interaction of  various risks could result in diminution or increase in risk, the risk  management process should recognize and reflect risk  interactions in all business activities as appropriate. While assessing and managing risk the management should have an overall view of risks the institution is exposed to. This requires  having a structure in place to look at risk interrelationships across  the institution.   1.5.9  Contingency Planning    1.5.9.1 Institutions should have a mechanism to identify stress situations  ahead of time and plans to deal with such unusual situations in a  timely and effective manner. Stress situations to which this principle applies include risks of all types. For instance  contingency planning activities include disaster recovery  planning, public relations damage control, litigation strategy,  responding to regulatory criticism, liquidity crisis, etc.  Contingency plans should be revi ewed regularly to ensure they  encompass reasonably probable events that could impact the  institution.

Credit risk arises from on balance sheet claims such as loans and overdrafts as well as off bala nce sheet commitments such as  guarantees, letters of credit, and derivative instruments. For most  institutions, loans are the largest and most obvious source of  credit risk.      2.1.2 In addition, an institution may also be exposed to credit risk when  dealing with foreign exchange operations. This may arise when a  domestic borrower involved in export business fails to compete in  foreign markets due to domestic currency appreciation and thus resulting in inability to repay the domestic loan.    2.1.3 In an institution’s portfolio, losses stem from outright default due  to inability or unwillingness of a customer or counter party to meet commitments in relation to lending, trading, settlement and other financial transactions. Al ternatively, losses may result  from reduction in portfolio value due to actual or perceived  deterioration in credit quality. Credit risk emanates from an  institution’s dealing with individuals, corporate, financial  institutions or a sovereign.     2.1.4 Credit risk not necessarily occurs in isolation.

The credit procedures  should aim to obtain an in depth understanding of the  institution’s clients, their credentials & their businesses in order to  fully know their customers.      2.3.1.3  The strategy should provide continuity in approach and take into  account cyclic aspect of country’s economy and the resulting  shifts in composition and quality of overall credit portfolio.

To be effective, policies should be communicated in a  timely fashion, and should be implemented through all levels of  the institution by appropriate procedures.  Any significant  deviation/exception to these policies must be communicated to   Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions, 2010  19the senior management/board and corrective measures should  be taken. At minimum credit policies should include:    (a) general areas of credit in which the institution is prepared to  engage or is restricted from engaging such as type of  credit facilities, type of collateral security, types of  borrowers, geographical areas or economic sectors on which the institution may focus on;    (b) detailed and formalized cr edit evaluation/ appraisal  process, administration and documentation;    (c) credit approval authority at various hierarchy levels  including authority for approving exceptions such as credit  extension beyond prescribed limits;    (d) concentration limits on single counterparties and groups of  connected counterparties, particular industries or economic sectors, geographical areas and specific  products",What is the purpose of establishing lines of authority in credit risk management?,"[""To ensure that credit decisions are made in accordance with the institution's credit strategy and policies."", 'To grant credit based on various client segments and products, economic sectors, geographical location, currency, and maturity.', ""To ensure that the institution's credit portfolio is soundly and conservatively valued, uncollectible exposure written off, and probable losses adequately provided for."", 'To establish an effective reporting system with respect to the content, format, and frequency of information concerning the credit portfolio and credit risk.']",0,Risk_Management_Guidelines.pdf

The  criteria should set out who is eligible for credit and for how much, what types of credit are available, and under what terms and conditions the credits should be granted.    2.3.3.1.2  Institutions must receive sufficient information to enable a  comprehensive assessment of the true risk profile of the borrower or counterparty. At minimum, the factors to be considered and  documented in approving credits must include:    (a) the purpose of the credit and source of repayment;    (b) the integrity and reputation of the borrower or  counterparty;    (c) the current risk profile (including the nature and aggregate  amounts of risks) of the borrower or counterparty and its sensitivity to economic and market developments;    (d) the borrower’s repayment history and current capacity to  repay, based on historical financial trends and cash flow projections;    (e) a forward-looking analysis of the capacity to repay based  on various scenarios;    (f) the legal capacity of the borrower or counterparty to  assume the liability;    (g) for commercial credits, the borrower’s business expertise  and the status of the borrower’s economic sector and its  position within that sector;    (h) the proposed terms and conditions of the credit, including  covenants designed to limit changes in the future risk profile  of the borrower; and    (i) where applicable, the adequacy and enforceability of  collateral or guarantees.    2.3.3.1.3  Once credit-granting criteria have been established, it is essential  for the institution to ensure that the information it receives is  sufficient to make proper credit-granting decisions. This  information may also serve as the basis for rating the credit under  the institution’s internal rating system.    2.3.3.1.4  Institutions need to understand to whom they are granting credit.  Therefore, prior to entering into any new credit relationship, an   Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions, 2010  21institution must become familiar with the borrower or counterparty  and be confident that they are dealing with an individual or  organization of sound repute and creditworthiness. In particular, strict policies must be in place to avoid association with individuals involved in fraudulent activities and other crimes.
