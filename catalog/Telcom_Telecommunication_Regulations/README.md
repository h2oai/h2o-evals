# Sample Questions

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the role of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in promoting telecommunications development in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union?

**Answer:** The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) supports telecommunications privatization in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union through the provision of equity or long-term debt financing to newly privatized companies and by providing pre-privatization finance. It also supports regulatory reform through its Technical Co-operation Programme, which has provided assistance to national authorities in establishing and improving the telecommunications legal and regulatory framework.

#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What was the motivation behind the privatization and liberalization of telecommunications markets in the last decade of the 20th century?

**Answer:** The motivation behind the privatization and liberalization of telecommunications markets was to increase competition, attract private sector capital, expand and upgrade telecommunications networks, introduce new services, and serve customers better.

**Token Presence:** ['increase', 'attract', 'expand', 'upgrade', 'introduce', 'serve']

#### Sample Multi choice questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What led to the growth of mobile and other wireless services?

**Answer:** ['The need to attract private sector capital to expand and upgrade telecommunications networks, and to introduce new services', 'Growth of the Internet, which caused data traffic to overtake voice traffic in many countries, and led to the introduction of many new service providers', 'Development of international trade in telecommunications services, which are increasingly provided by transnational and global service providers', 'Increasing evidence that more liberalized telecommunications markets were growing and innovating faster and serving customers better']
