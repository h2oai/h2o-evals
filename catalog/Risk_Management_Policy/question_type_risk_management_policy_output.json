It helps to identify whether the risk has been reduced to an acceptable level, and it plays a crucial role in the assessment of risk, particularly in the financial area. The map is used to evaluate the impact and likelihood of a risk, and it helps to identify the level of reporting required for each risk. The map is also used to monitor and review risks over time, ensuring that they are being managed and maintained at an acceptable level. By using the Residual Risk Heat Map, the University can effectively manage risks and minimize their impact on the institution."
