These requirements differ from those in Navy projects in terms of the specific technologies and configurations used, as well as the coordination and approval processes involved. For example, USMC projects require a minimum of two optical splitters per floor, while Navy projects require only one. Additionally, USMC projects require a specific configuration for patch panels and patch cords, while Navy projects allow for more flexibility in their design. Furthermore, USMC projects have different requirements for the installation of ICDS or backbone cabling, and the coordination and approval processes for these projects involve different personnel and agencies than those in Navy projects."
