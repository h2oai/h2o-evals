Some activities for understanding the registered entity  and its operational environment  are  described below.        NERC | ERO Enterprise Inherent Risk Assessment Guide | October 2014   3 2.0 IRA Process     The IRA process involves:    Gathering and maintaining registered entity specific info rmation and data (e.g., past performance,  historical registered entity information on file within CEA Entity databases).    Proactively identifying risk trends and prevalent practices at the registered entity.    Establishing qualitative and quantitative risk fa ctors for evaluating whether areas and levels of  oversight focus is appropriate.    Considering the applicability and significance of standards / requirements that may apply to an entity  based on the assets they own or operate.    Identifying areas where specia l consideration may be necessary.  Some examples include (1) changes  to the entity’s asset composition, (2) unique power system configuration or unique organizational  structure, or (3) significant system events.    Understanding a registered entity’s interna l environment, including the tone of the organization and  compliance environment for compliance with Reliability Standards.      The CEA  should gather and review  information  about a particular registered entity  for appropriateness ( relevance )  and sufficiency  (completeness and accura cy) to afford a reasonable basis for a conclusion.  During this process,  the CEA should leverage  knowledgeable  parties, both internal and external,  to provide input as necessary .   Professional judgment should be applied during the process and documented to support the conclusions reached.

NERC | ERO Enterprise Inherent Risk Assessment Guide | October 2014   3 2.0 IRA Process     The IRA process involves:    Gathering and maintaining registered entity specific info rmation and data (e.g., past performance,  historical registered entity information on file within CEA Entity databases).    Proactively identifying risk trends and prevalent practices at the registered entity.    Establishing qualitative and quantitative risk fa ctors for evaluating whether areas and levels of  oversight focus is appropriate.    Considering the applicability and significance of standards / requirements that may apply to an entity  based on the assets they own or operate.    Identifying areas where specia l consideration may be necessary.  Some examples include (1) changes  to the entity’s asset composition, (2) unique power system configuration or unique organizational  structure, or (3) significant system events.    Understanding a registered entity’s interna l environment, including the tone of the organization and  compliance environment for compliance with Reliability Standards.      The CEA  should gather and review  information  about a particular registered entity  for appropriateness ( relevance )  and sufficiency  (completeness and accura cy) to afford a reasonable basis for a conclusion.  During this process,  the CEA should leverage  knowledgeable  parties, both internal and external,  to provide input as necessary .   Professional judgment should be applied during the process and documented to support the conclusions reached.

"The IRA considers  outputs   from the risk element s (see section  1.2.1 for more details ). IRA results are key input sources to the Internal  Controls Evaluation (ICE) , if used, and in determining an  overall compliance oversight plan for a registered  entity.  Figure 1  below Illustrates the role of IRA within the Framework.           Figure 1. Risk -based Compliance Oversight Framework   The IRA is based on an entity’s unique inherent risks to the reliability of the BPS.  T he IRA guides CEAs in identifying  risks and determining areas of focus for a specific registered entity. The IRA process will also identify  specific  Reliability Standards and Requirements that the CEA should consider for compliance oversight.       1.2 Major inputs into the IRA     1.2.1 Risk Eleme nt Inputs   The ERO Enterprise assesses risks to the reliability of the BPS,  as well as mitigating factors that may reduce or  eliminate a given reliability risk. The ERO Enterprise developed a Risk Elements Guide that describes  the process  for identifying risks to the BPS and maps associated registration functional categories and Reliability Standards to  those risks.       1.0 IRA Introduction     NERC | ERO Enterprise Inherent Risk Assessment Guide | October 2014   2 CEAs should use the annual ERO CMEP Implementation Plan, including the Regional Implementation Plans, as  input int o the IRA.  The ERO CMEP Implementation Plan identifies specific:    ERO Enterprise risks to the r eliability of the BPS  for compliance monitoring.    Associated Reliability Standards and Requirements mapped to the reliability risks.    Regional risk considerations.     Refer to the Risk Elements Guide  and the annual ERO CMEP Implementation Plans for further details.     1.2.2 Understanding the Registered En tity  Understanding a registered entity  is an essential aspect of the IRA  and of the Framework .

To illustrate the Applicability Review, refer to the example below. Using collected registered entity information,  the CEA will first determine whether or not certain risk factors and associated Reliability  Standards and  Requirements are applicable to the registered entity.     Example: Applicability of Certain Risk Factors and Reliability  Standards and Requirements     Risk factor : Under Voltage Load Shedding (UVLS)  consideration     Information Attribute:  Entity has automated U VLS and  stated that it recently utilized UVLS      Standard and Requirement Considerations : EOP-003-2 R2                                                                 2 An entity’s functional designation is based on the nature of the entity which includes, for example: (1) balancing authorities, (2)  distribution providers, (3) generator operators, (4) generator owners, (5) reliability coordinators, (6) transmission operato rs, and (7)  transmission owners.  2.0 IRA Process     NERC | ERO Enterprise Inherent Risk Assessment Guide | October 2014   7 Decision criteria:  Does the information collected indicate an applicable risk factor that should be considered in  further analysis?     Applicability Review and Conclusion:   Yes, the entity indicated it recently utilized its automated UVLS. Therefore,  the CEA should further evaluate the risk factor and apply criteria to determine the depth of focus for this risk  factor.     Note: The example above is for illustrative purposes only.  W hen making the determination of what would be  applicable to a specific registered entity, the CEA will need to identify all relevant risk factors and associated  Reliability  Standards and Requirements based on the information gathered.     2.2.1.3 Risk Factor  Analysis    After performing the Applicability Review, the CEA reviews the collected entity -specific information, as well as  other known risks to the reliability of the BPS (i.e., inputs from Risk Elements as reflected in the CMEP IP), to  determine areas o f focus within the registered entity. Risk factors associated with the registered entity are  weighted based on risk factor evaluation criteria as shown by the criteria columns in the Appendix C – Risk Factor  Examples.     The CEA should reconfirm the Reliabi lity Standards and R equirement s that are applicable to the registered entity’s  function. For example, risk f actors associated with special protective systems ( SPSs) do not apply to a Transmission  Operator ( TOP) that does  not have SPSs within its footprint.  Additionally, a  Vegetation Management risk element  may  not present a high risk to an entity operating in the  desert in the  Southwest  if the entity operates in a climate  with no or very limited vegetation that can affect transmission lines . Once the CEA reconfirms the Reliability  Standards and Requirements applicable to the registered entity, based on the defined risk factor evaluation  criteria , it will assess the risk factors applicable to  the registered e ntity and determine the level of ri sk associated  with each risk factor.     Refer to Appendix C  for a list of risk factors and risk factor criteria that can be used as a guide when determining  an entity’s unique inherent risks to the  reliability of the  BPS.  Although Appendix C can assist in evaluating the  criteria of applied risk factors, consideration must be made for a registered entity’s size or function.  The relative  importance of a particular risk -factor criterion may need to be evaluated compared to a registered entity’s size  or funct ion.     Certain risk factors and the associated criteria/thresholds may vary by region, by entity size, or by function",How are risk factors weighted in the Risk Factor Analysis?,"['According to the risk factor evaluation criteria in Appendix C.', ""According to the entity's size or function."", 'According to the relative importance of the risk factor criterion.', ""According to the CEA's discretion.""]",0,Inherent_Risk_Assessment.pdf

Example: Applicability of Certain Risk Factors and Reliability  Standards and Requirements     Risk factor : Under Voltage Load Shedding (UVLS)  consideration     Information Attribute:  Entity has automated U VLS and  stated that it recently utilized UVLS      Standard and Requirement Considerations : EOP-003-2 R2                                                                 2 An entity’s functional designation is based on the nature of the entity which includes, for example: (1) balancing authorities, (2)  distribution providers, (3) generator operators, (4) generator owners, (5) reliability coordinators, (6) transmission operato rs, and (7)  transmission owners.  2.0 IRA Process     NERC | ERO Enterprise Inherent Risk Assessment Guide | October 2014   7 Decision criteria:  Does the information collected indicate an applicable risk factor that should be considered in  further analysis?     Applicability Review and Conclusion:   Yes, the entity indicated it recently utilized its automated UVLS. Therefore,  the CEA should further evaluate the risk factor and apply criteria to determine the depth of focus for this risk  factor.     Note: The example above is for illustrative purposes only.  W hen making the determination of what would be  applicable to a specific registered entity, the CEA will need to identify all relevant risk factors and associated  Reliability  Standards and Requirements based on the information gathered.     2.2.1.3 Risk Factor  Analysis    After performing the Applicability Review, the CEA reviews the collected entity -specific information, as well as  other known risks to the reliability of the BPS (i.e., inputs from Risk Elements as reflected in the CMEP IP), to  determine areas o f focus within the registered entity. Risk factors associated with the registered entity are  weighted based on risk factor evaluation criteria as shown by the criteria columns in the Appendix C – Risk Factor  Examples.     The CEA should reconfirm the Reliabi lity Standards and R equirement s that are applicable to the registered entity’s  function. For example, risk f actors associated with special protective systems ( SPSs) do not apply to a Transmission  Operator ( TOP) that does  not have SPSs within its footprint.  Additionally, a  Vegetation Management risk element  may  not present a high risk to an entity operating in the  desert in the  Southwest  if the entity operates in a climate  with no or very limited vegetation that can affect transmission lines . Once the CEA reconfirms the Reliability  Standards and Requirements applicable to the registered entity, based on the defined risk factor evaluation  criteria , it will assess the risk factors applicable to  the registered e ntity and determine the level of ri sk associated  with each risk factor.     Refer to Appendix C  for a list of risk factors and risk factor criteria that can be used as a guide when determining  an entity’s unique inherent risks to the  reliability of the  BPS.  Although Appendix C can assist in evaluating the  criteria of applied risk factors, consideration must be made for a registered entity’s size or function.  The relative  importance of a particular risk -factor criterion may need to be evaluated compared to a registered entity’s size  or funct ion.     Certain risk factors and the associated criteria/thresholds may vary by region, by entity size, or by function",How does the CEA determine the level of risk associated with each risk factor?,"['The CEA will assess the risk factors applicable to the registered entity and determine the level of risk associated with each risk factor based on the defined risk factor evaluation criteria in Appendix C.', ""The CEA will evaluate the relative importance of each risk factor criterion compared to the registered entity's size or function."", 'The CEA will consider risk factors and associated criteria/thresholds that vary by region, by entity size, or by function.', ""The CEA will reconfirm the Reliability Standards and Requirements applicable to the registered entity's function.""]",0,Inherent_Risk_Assessment.pdf

As needed,  CEAs may work with the registered entity to ensure the CEA has appropriate and sufficient information to conduct  the IRA an d reach accurate conclusions. After the CEA finalizes IRA results, the CEA should share the summary  results with the registered entity (including risk areas and impact on the scope of monitoring) .    CEAs are owners of the IRA process and CEAs are ultimately responsible for assessing inherent risks and potential  risks to reliabilit y posed by a registered entity.     2.5 Frequency and Revision of Inherent Risk Assessment   The IRA will be performed on a periodic basis, with the frequency based on a variety of factors including, but  not limited to, changes to a registered entity and signi ficant changes or emergence of new reliability risks.     CEAs can review and revise the IRA of a registered entity at any time and should be cognizant of the effect that a  registered entity’s risks may pose to maintaining a reliable BPS.  This understanding is essential in performing  an IRA, as it establishes a frame of reference by which the IRA is conducted.  Importantly, an IRA may need  to be revised as new, emerging, or unique information is obtained either about the registered entity or about risks  to the reliability of the BPS.  Some activities that occur and drive an IRA revision may include a system event,  change in complian ce history or activity, significant change to organization structure, changes to Reliability  Standards, etc.  For example, if a registered entity’s current IRA is based on ownership of a specific asset, but the  registered entity later sells or retires that  asset, the CEA should revise the IRA to consider the asset ownership  change. Similarly, if an event occurs that highlights a never -before -considered reliability risk, the CEA should  consider whether it needs to revisit an IRA to determine how the new reli ability risk impacts a registered entity.     2",What triggers a revision of the IRA?,"[""Changes to a registered entity's risk management practices."", 'Emergence of new reliability risks or significant changes to existing risks.', ""Changes to the CEA's assessment methodology."", ""The CEA's annual review process.""]",1,Inherent_Risk_Assessment.pdf
"For example, if a registered entity’s current IRA is based on ownership of a specific asset, but the  registered entity later sells or retires that  asset, the CEA should revise the IRA to consider the asset ownership  change. Similarly, if an event occurs that highlights a never -before -considered reliability risk, the CEA should  consider whether it needs to revisit an IRA to determine how the new reli ability risk impacts a registered entity.     2.6 IRA Feedback into ERO Enterprise Processes   An ERO Enterprise  feedback loop involving compliance monitoring  activities will help inform future priorities ,  projects in the NERC standards development process , and other ERO Enterprise program areas .  As CEAs conduct  IRAs, CEAs may identify certain risk focus areas that do not map to current, enforceable Reliability Standards. The  CEAs may also determine other gaps, revisions, or retirement needs of Reliability St andards or other program  activities.  That  feedback loop will mature with  more experience implementing  risk-based compliance monitoring  methods.        NERC | ERO Enterprise Inherent Risk Assessment Guide | October 2014   11 3.0 IRA Documentation     3.1 Results Documentation   The CEAs should follow established docu mentation protocols, refer to the NERC Rules of Procedure, and use its  professional judgment, where appropriate, when determining documentation needs throughout the IRA process.  The CEA should maintain documentation that clearly supports conclusions made a round oversight scope.  Documentation includes all data and information obtained, reviewed, and used as inputs to the IRA, and should  be linked to conclusions so that one can easily see why final determinations were made.  The CEAs should maintain  documenta tion, demonstrating the nature and extent of information reviewed and IRA conclusions reached.     The extent of the resulting documentation is directly linked to the (1) nature, size, and complexity of the issues,  (2) procedures performed, and (3) methodolog ies and technologies used during the process.  The more significant  and complex these factors are, the greater and more detailed the documentation may be.     3.2 D ocumentation Retention   Upon completion of the IRA process, the CEA should retain relevant docum entation that supports the procedures  performed and conclusions reached.  Examples of d ocumentation that should be retained includes, but is not be  limited to, the following: IRA programs, analys es, memoranda, summaries of significant findings or issues,  checklists, abstracts, copies of important documents, and paper or electronic correspondence concerning  significant findings or issues.  Additionally, finalized narrative descriptions, questionnaires, checklists, and  flowcharts created through the IRA proce ss are also considered important documentation and should be retained.
