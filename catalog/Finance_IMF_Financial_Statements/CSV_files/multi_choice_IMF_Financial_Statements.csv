In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.

Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA",What is the name of the international organization that is the subject of the financial statements?,"['International Monetary Fund (IMF)', 'World Bank', 'World Trade Organization (WTO)', 'United Nations (UN)']",0,IMF_Financial_Statements.pdf
"During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages","What was the investment objective of the Fixed-Income Subaccount during the financial year ended April 30, 2022?","['To achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term.', 'To achieve returns that exceed the SDR interest rate by a margin of 50 basis points over time.', 'To provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income member countries.', 'To protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery.']",1,IMF_Financial_Statements.pdf

SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes.

The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43",What is the basis of preparation and measurement for the financial statements of the General Department?,"['Historical cost convention', 'Fair value through profit or loss', 'Going concern basis', 'International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)']",3,IMF_Financial_Statements.pdf

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.

The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights.

"The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.

The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).

The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics",What is the basis for accounting for financial instruments in the financial statements of the General Department?,"['Fair value', 'Historical cost', 'Net realizable value', 'Amortized cost']",3,IMF_Financial_Statements.pdf

Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13",What is the basis for assessing credit risk for the General Department's exposure to a member country?,"['The status of the economic programs underlying IMF financing.', ""The member's cooperation on policy implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations."", ""The member's capacity to repay, based on forward-looking assessments."", ""The risk of default, based on the member's credit history.""]",2,IMF_Financial_Statements.pdf

Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.
