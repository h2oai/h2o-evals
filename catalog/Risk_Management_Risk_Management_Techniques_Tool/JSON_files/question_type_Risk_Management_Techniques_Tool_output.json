Additionally, a compliance management program provides a basis for Customs to assess its own performance in revenue protection and enforcement of laws, improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and develop strategies to improve compliance. One approach to compliance measurement is to focus on the top 5-10% of highest volume manufacturers, importers, exporters, and commodities, and measure compliance in areas such as documentary issues, procedural issues, revenue issues, transport issues, and specific concerns. Customs can also gather data from various sources, both internal and external, and use automated and manual means to arrive at reasonable, informed conclusions about compliance rates. They can determine an acceptable level of compliance, use a statistically valid sampling methodology to select specific transactions or entities for review or verification, and modify the universe of transactions based on the results. Finally, they can use a variety of transaction processes for compliance verifications, such as goods declaration compliance, trader compliance, transit compliance, free trade zone or warehouse compliance, manifest and transport document compliance, and transporter compliance."

Potential risk criteria that could be used in conjunction with the scale include severity of risk, risk likelihood, potential impact, and level of control.

The IRM system also assists divisions with their decision making and enables possible efficiencies in organizational integration. The Risk Management Council, which is established as part of the NTC, plays a crucial role in this process by setting high-risk areas biannually, assessing risks, and setting priorities for targeting and policy making. The council also monitors and measures compliance, detects risk trends, and provides feedback to the KCS for intelligence integration. This feedback is used to update the risk profiles and risk trends, which in turn enables the KCS to identify high-risk areas and importers, and to prepare for targeting and policy making. The KCS's use of the IRM system and its integration with the NTC enables the organization to effectively identify and prevent wrong classification of goods, such as the misclassification of fabrics with scalloping edges, by leveraging technology-intensive information management and close cooperation among related entities, including border agencies and other countries."
