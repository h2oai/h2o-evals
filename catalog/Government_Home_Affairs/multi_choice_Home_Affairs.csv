Where a traveller presents two passports/travel documents (with the same bio- data) and one is valid and the  other has expired, the PLO must:   • scan the valid passport/travel document first, both to confirm its genuineness and if a visa is  attached   • continue processing on the valid passport/travel document if there is a valid visa attached   • if a visa record against the valid passport/travel document is not located,  the traveller should  be processed on their expired passport/travel document and if it holds a valid visa (other than an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA)), the PLO should manually referred to the BCO   • if by following the above process, the PLO verifies that the visa linked to the expired passport/travel document was an ETA, the relevant movement should be cancelled in PACE and then the PLO must process the traveller on the new passport/travel document and refer  to the BCO for secondary clearance.  This is because an ETA is linked to the passport/travel  document it is granted to. If the passport/travel document has expired or the traveller is travelling on another passport/travel document, the ETA is no longer valid.

Actioning referrals   The BCO is to request from the PLO:   • a manual referral if a system referral is not generated   • the traveller’s passport/travel document and incoming passenger card (IPC) with the code I  placed at the bottom left hand corner on the front of the IPC near the word ‘declaration’ . For  more information, see Passenger Card Coding – PI (BC-667).  The BCO should determine why the traveller has arrived without a visa. Under these circumstances,  travellers will typically be referred for  the following referral reason codes:    The BCO should note that travellers arriving without a valid visa may be the result of an unresolved visa status issue, such as:   • the visa cannot be located due to data discrepancies   • the passport/travel document against which the visa was granted has expired   • the passport/travel document against which the visa was granted has been lost or stol en  • the person holds two passports/travel documents, one valid and one expired.

Purpose  The Border (Temporary) (Class TA) (Subclass 773) visa (the Border visa) provides, in very limited  circumstances, an option for non- citizen travellers who arrive in Australia without  holding  a visa or whose  visa has been cancelled in immigration clearance to enter Australia.    Border visas are intended for travellers who will be able to regularise their visa status through the application  and grant of another  substanti ve visa, shortly after they enter Australia.  Border visas, however, are not  intended as a substitute for other visas in circumstances where the traveller has not obtained a visa prior to travelling to Australia; there should always be some mitigating factor justifying granting a Border visa.   If the reason for travelling to Australia is compelling, subject to meeting the prescribed requirements, a  traveller may be considered for a Border visa while they are in immigration clearance.   For more information on the legal requirements and related policies that apply to the Border visa , see  Subclass 773 (Border) visa – PI (VM-4830) .  This Procedural Instruction (PI) provides information on operationalising the legal requirements and related policies and procedures that apply to the Subclass 773 (Border) visa (the Border visa).     2. Scope  2.1. In Scope   This PI applies to Australian Border Force (ABF) Border Clearance Officers (BCO)  in the airports and, in  limited circumstances,  seaports providing immigration clearance under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration  Act).  2.2. Out of  Scope   This PI does not cover:   • consideration and grant of a border visa after immigration clearance   • clearance of travellers and/or goods under the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act).     3. Procedural Instruction   3.1. Reasons for considering a Border visa   The Border visa provides a pathway in limited circumstance to certain non- citizen travellers who:   • arrive in Australi a not holding a visa where there is a ‘good reason’ for them not holding a visa;  or  • whose visa is cancelled in immigration clearance; and   • are seeking to be immigration cleared.   Released by Department of Home Affairs  under the Freedom of Information Act 1982    OFFICIAL           OFFICIAL    Page 4 of 19 Subclass 773 (Border) visa grant in  Immigration Clearance  BCOs are not obliged to advise travellers in immigration clearance of the existence of the Border visa.  However, they should turn their mind to this visa type prior to making a determination that a traveller is  otherwise unable to satisfy immigration clearance requirements.   Before considering a Border visa for a traveller, the officer must turn their mind to:   • the traveller’s eligibility for a Border  visa  • with the exception of a person to whom s ub-clause 773.213(1)(c) of the Migration Regulations  1994 (the Regulations) applies, whether the traveller has:   o compelling reasons for granting a Border visa to the traveller;   o the traveller’s presence in Australia would not be contrary to Australia’s interests;   o has a good reason for not holding a visa on arrival .  The decisions to consider a Border visa for a traveller must be determined on a case- by-case basis having  considered all of the traveller’s circumstances.   3.2",Who is eligible for a Border visa?,"['All non-citizen travellers who arrive in Australia without a visa or whose visa has been cancelled in immigration clearance.', 'Non-citizen travellers who have compelling reasons for granting a Border visa and meet the requirements of Subclass 773 (Border) visa.', 'Non-citizen travellers who are seeking to be immigration cleared and have a good reason for not holding a visa.', 'All non-citizen travellers who are in immigration clearance, regardless of their circumstances.']",1,Home_Affairs.pdf
"213(1)(c) of the Migration Regulations  1994 (the Regulations) applies, whether the traveller has:   o compelling reasons for granting a Border visa to the traveller;   o the traveller’s presence in Australia would not be contrary to Australia’s interests;   o has a good reason for not holding a visa on arrival .  The decisions to consider a Border visa for a traveller must be determined on a case- by-case basis having  considered all of the traveller’s circumstances.   3.2. Ineligible persons   The following classes of travellers are ineligible for the grant of a Border visa:   • protection claimants – travellers who seek to engage Australia’s protection obligations and to  remain in Australia on humanitarian grounds on arrival are unable to satisfy the criteria for the  grant of a Border visa (clause 773.212) of the Regulations   • traveller subject to 5- year exclusion period - previous Border visa holders who are prescribed  under sub- clauses  773.213(1)(e), (f) or (g) of the Regulations – if a person had been granted a  Border visa in the last five years they will be ineligible for a further visa of the same type unless  compelling reasons exist and meet the sub- clause 773.216(2) - see section Assessing Five- year  exclusion period   • travellers who are affected by an exclusion period such as Special Return Criteria  (SRC)  5001  (where the person’s visa was previously cancelled under section 501 of the Migration Act) or  SRC  5002 (where the person has previously been removed from Australia), see section 3.9 –  Assessing application   • travellers who have been advised to not travel to Australia pending their section 501  assessment.  For further information regarding the section 501 character test, please refer to   s501 The character test, visa refusal and visa cancellation – PI (VM-1001) .  3.3. Eligibile categories   For full details of the legal requirements and related policies that apply to the Border visa , see Subclass 773  (Border ) visa – PI (VM-4830).  In summary, under clause 773.213 of the Regulations, the following travellers may be eligible for a Border  visa:   • Spouse/de facto partner (whether of the same sex or opposite sex) of an Australian citizen,  Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen   • a traveller who is apparently eligible for a Return (Residence) visa or Resident Return (Temporary) visa   Released by Department of Home Affairs  under the Freedom of Information Act 1982    OFFICIAL           OFFICIAL    Page 5 of 19 Subclass 773 (Border) visa grant in  Immigration Clearance  • accompanying dependent children of an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident, an  eligible New Zealand citizen or the holder of a prescribed visa (specified in sub-c lauses  773.213(2), (3) or (4)   • certain returning former holders of visas specified in sub- clauses 773.213(3) or (4) who have a  close relative in Australia   • returning former student visa holders (there are special requirements for Foreign Affairs recipients or Foreign Affairs students that they are required to have the support of the Foreign Minister)   • traveller who seeks to remain in Australia on a temporary basis and who, from the visa application information, appears to be a person who is eligible for grant of a:   o Visitor visas ( Subclass 651 (eVisitor) or Subclass  600 (Visitor)   o Subclass 771 (Transit) visa for a traveller seeking to transit  through Australia   o Temporary Work (Short Stay Specialist / subclass 400).
