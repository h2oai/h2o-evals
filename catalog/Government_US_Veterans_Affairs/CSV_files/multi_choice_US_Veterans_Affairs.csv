"Section 508 Compliance Statement The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is committed to making its electronic and information technologies accessible to indi viduals  with disabilities in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (Title 29 U.S.C. § 794d), as amended in 1999.

Please click on the following link to access the 508 Compliant FY2018 -2024 VA Strategi c Plan:  Department of Veterans Affairs   FY 2018  2024 Strategic Plan  LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is committed to providing excellent care and  benefits to our Nation's Veterans. We continue to serve over nine million Veterans who  served through periods of peace and conflict to include WWII, the Korean War, Vietnam as  well as the Gulf Wars. We anticipate that many more Veterans will require VA care and  services in the future. I intend to ensure that VA will be there to serve them and their  families.  VA provides many types of care and benefits tailored to Veterans that are not available in  the private sector. In addition to providing some of the best overall high-quality health care  in the country, VA delivers exceptional care in polytrauma, spinal cord injury and  rehabilitation, prosthetics, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress treatments and  other behavioral health programs. VA plays a critical role in preparing our Nation's doctors  and nurses -70 percent of whom train at VA facilities. And we lead the Nation in innovation, with VA research having  contributed to the first liver transplant, development of the cardiac pacemaker, advancements in treatments for Post­ Traumatic Stress Disorder, cutting-edge prosthetics, and many other medical breakthroughs. We also lead the Nation in  providing access to health care through telehealth. But we have much more work to do.  As VA moves forward with its modernization efforts, we will incorporate Veterans' input to build a system that works best  for them-a customer and clinically-driven system. In order to do that, we must build a VA that competes successfully with  the private sector. If we maintain the status quo, VA will fail and Veterans will be put at risk. VA faces many challenges that  require a fundamental change to the way we think and operate to competitively serve our Veterans.  To ensure our success, VA will focus resources on foundational services that Veterans need most, and leverage Federal  partners, community providers, and private partners to offer care and services where needed. This will provide Veterans  access to the best of both VA and the private sector. We do not want Veterans to choose VA because they have no other  choice; we want them to choose VA because we perform well for Veterans and their families. When we uphold high  standards of care and services, equal to or better than the private sector, they will choose us as their provider.  Our disability system must be reformed. We need a system that promotes wellness and recovery rather than disincentivize  them. We will modernize our systems and process for claims and appeals to ensure Veterans receive decisions quickly and  are empowered to make informed choices about their benefits.  VA must continue to invest in ground breaking research that contributes to the quality of life for Veterans-and for all  Americans. We also need to modernize our procurement and information technology services, continue our investments in  21st century technology, like telehealth to increase access to care, and better leverage our existing infrastructure while  teaming up with private partners to invest in state-of-the-art facilities.  This strategic plan focuses on the positive outcomes we will achieve in partnership with our Veterans and builds on the  improvements we have made, and will continue to make, on behalf of Veterans and their families everywhere.

Commitment is a thread that runs through all the goals and will remain  unchanged through the volatile and complex future VA business environment. Achieving Excellence is the only  performance target acceptable in a VA that is hyper- focused on improving the lives and outcomes of our Nation’s  Veterans. Pursuit of excellence drives innovation, agility, and better outcomes.   VA STRATEGIC GOALS   VA is dedicated to providing excellent care and services to the Veterans who courageously undertook the mantle  of defense of the Nation.   The aforementioned five priorities shaped the strategic goals of this plan. These goals describe the outcomes  Veterans can anticipate from VA. Developing these goals involved assessment of historic and current operations,  seeking out leading practices in health care, benefits delivery, and customer service, as well as benchmarking best  practices in business operations, including integration of technology into business, human capital management ,  facilities management, and organizational governance.  To deliver on our priorities, VA will aggressively seize opportunities  driven by rapid advancements in technology and ground-breaking  research to provide Veterans cutting-edge treatment and means to  access care, benefits, and services. VA will benefit the Veteran and the  general public by advancing the understanding of Veteran-specific  illness and injuries, by developing new treatments for these illnesses  and injuries, and by advancing the fields of genomic and personalized  medicine to prevent future illness and improve the effectivenss of  treatments. These advances will be critical as VA serves an evolving  Veteran population shaped by rapidly shifting battlefie lds and tactics  that generate ever-changing injuries and illnesses.  To better adapt to future operating challenges, including growing and changing Veteran demand for services , VA  will modernize its practices to become an agile and efficient provider of benefits and care. VA is currently  undertaking a modernization effort, in accordance with the Presidential Executive Order6 and memo M- 17-22 from  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),7 to reform the Department . The modernization effort is also guided  by the five priorities and it challenges VA to improve delivery, internal organization, and governance, and to  upgrade systems and enhance access for Vetera ns. These efforts will also determine over the long run where VA  will focus its budget to best enhance Veteran outcomes and experiences . VA understands that it cannot do this  alone . The key to modernization is creating greater interoperability with Governmental partners, including DoD, in  6 The White House, Presidential Executive Order on a Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch,  (2017).  7 Executive Office of the President,  Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies M- 17-22, (2017).

We will  partner with others to ensure Veterans can get their benefits, care, and services consistently , easily, and with  excellent customer service, no matter where they are throughout their lives. VA will work with local communities,  and with other Federal, S tate, Tribal, and Local Government entities to ensure Veterans get what they need. VA  will also continue to leverage the private sector where appropriate and needed to deliver the very best outcomes  for Veterans.   Most importantly, in order to provide excellent customer service, VA  must deeply understand what Veterans, their families, caregivers ,  and supporters need . We will communicate with the Veteran and  their families while they are still in military service, and then will  continue to do so throughout their lives. Our communication with  Veterans and their support groups will no longer simply focus on  getting their feedback after they are served by VA and its partners .  We will also ask their input beforehand to better understand what  new services they need, as well as to learn what changes we must  make to enhance outcomes for Veterans.

VA will combine understanding of the  Veteran with continuous market analyses of availability and quality of provider options to provide a better range of  choices for our Veterans.

"We communicate with Veterans  and their families in advance of their transition and throughout their civilian lives to understand how they are  faring . We understand the impacts and outcomes to our Veterans as they use VA benefits, care, and services and  use this information to either improve outcomes or to ensure we consistently keep doing what works.    V A  F Y 2 0 1 8   2 0 2 4  S t r a te g i c  P la n   11  1.2 PERFORMANCE GOAL    Veterans agree that they received timely, relevant,  and easy to understand information from VA that  empowered them to make informed choices about  their benefits, services, and care.    Veterans agree that the statement “I felt like a  valued customer” is true . ACHIEVING GREATER CH OICE:    VA competes for Veteran customers  by  improving customer  experience s and  outcomes.    Online navigator tools/information  empowers   Veterans to make decisions.    Sharing of equivalent  quality measures from  VA and the private sector  supports Veterans’  decisions.    Immediate survey and response capability   (as  appropriate)  captures customer information  where they are served.    Veteran and family journey maps  inform VA  deployment of benefits, care, and services.    Co-locating services will  improve access to  benefits and care.  STRATEGY 1.1.2: VA FOCUSES ON VETERAN O UTCOMES TO TAILOR CH OICE    To tailor  the choice of benefits and services , as wel l as  access to them for Veterans,  VA must constantly assess  how, why, when, and where Veterans are accessing  benefits, care, and services . VA must also understand  the outcomes and impacts Veterans experience as a  result of services provided by VA or VA ’s partners . VA  can no longer simply measure internal activit ies like the  number of forms processed or appointments made on  time. We must focus on understanding whether or not  our efforts improved Veteran health or well -being,  independence , economic security , or memorialization .  This focus on enhanced outcomes also requires VA to  implement choice as a system  based on clinically  and/or  customer -driven priorities informed by  Veterans ’ needs,  rather than the administrative rule -based system  currently in place today. VA will provide Veterans with  the information they need to make the choices that  work best for them.   STRATEGY 1.1.3: VA USES V ETERAN  JOURNEY MAPS TO ENHA NCE UNDERSTANDING    VA’s pledge to be Veteran focused means we mu st “walk in  our Veteran’s shoes .” In addition to communicating more  with our Veterans, VA will increase its use of  Veteran  journey maps , which describe the major life events and  moments Veterans routinely experience . This will help us  provide Veterans with  benefits, care , and  services more  appropriate to the stage of life they are experiencing. VA  will expand the use of the Veteran journey maps to enhance  our business functions , such as  acting on  operational risks  that impact Veteran outcomes; measuring tru e impacts to  Veterans using our benefits and services , and anticipating changes to service offerings based on Veteran stages of  life. Most importantly, the use of the Veteran journey maps will help VA personnel understand the Veteran’s  journey and relate b etter to our Veterans —a critical component of excellent customer service.

Most importantly,   improvements to  mobile devices and apps,  including our  VA Video Connect  app and  Provider C onnect features , will enable VA  providers to connect to Veterans across the  country to provide timely and convenient  care.  This will he lp reduce the amount of  time a Veteran needs to wait to see a  provider, eliminating  the need t o travel to a  VA or other Federal facility to be examined.    Video -based delivery of services is used by   VA’s business lines , like the Board of  Veterans ’ Appeals , which uses video  hearings to prevent unnecessary Veteran  travel and to expedite adjudication of  Veteran appeals.  Veterans are also able to  apply for any of their benefits via eBenefits  and will soon be able to check the status of  their claims , and/or applications,  online or  on their mobile devices.

GOAL 3: VETERANS TRUST VA TO BE CONSI STENTLY ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT   VA’s pledge to build lifelong, trusted relationships  with its Veterans is the basis for delivering relevant  and excellent benefits, care, and services to our  Veterans that enhance their lives. VA understands  that earni ng our Veterans’ trust is the gold  standard we aspire to achieve  and is critical to our  long -term success . How VA delivers on its promises  is just as important as what it delivers. VA will earn  trust and be the natural choice for Veterans by  holding itself  accountable, being transparent about  how we are performing, and showing how we  adhere to our core values  with every single  interaction.  Specifically , VA will focus on  accountability, transparency, and value.    a) Accountability : The Secretary set the standard  for excellence  in his State of VA  address, stating simply that  Veterans deserve the best, no matter where they are or who serves them . Accountability occurs at all levels  and is translated as follows:   - Organizational accountability: VA has clearly stated outcomes and consistently measures and shares the  value of its efforts on behalf of Veterans, measures the change for Veterans, acts on data , and works  within communities to build integrated networks of access and delivery .   - Personnel accountabili ty: Veterans deserve the best and brightest the Nation ha s to offer. VA only hires and  retains  individuals who embody our values. Leaders  and staff incorporate VA values into everything they  do and are measured by their adherence to those values for achiev ing positive outcomes for Veterans;  those who do not adhere  to VA’s values will no longer work for VA .  b)    Transparency: VA publicly  and consistently shares critical information, outcomes , and metrics showing how it  improved the Veteran’s experience, and  their  well-being, independence , and quality of life",How does VA plan to support families and caregivers of Veterans?,"['By providing them with access to healthcare services and resources.', 'By offering training and mentoring programs to help them care for Veterans.', ""By including them in Veterans' healthcare decision-making processes."", 'By giving them access to online support groups and resources.']",2,US_Veterans_Affairs.pdf
