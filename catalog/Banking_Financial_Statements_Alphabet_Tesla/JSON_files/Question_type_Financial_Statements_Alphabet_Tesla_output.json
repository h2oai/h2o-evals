Storage of food: Roots can store food in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and other nutrients that the plant may need during times of drought or stress.\r\n4. Production of hormones: Roots produce hormones that help regulate the plant's growth and development, such as auxins, which control cell elongation and cell division.\r\n5.
