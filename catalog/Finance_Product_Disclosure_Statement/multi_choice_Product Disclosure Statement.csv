However, the Company reserves the ability, at its absolute discretion, to permit the early repayment of Debenture Stock before the Maturity Date in the event of death or financial hardship.  The Company does not intend to quote the Debenture Stock on a licensed market in New Zealand and there is no other established market for trading them. This means that you may not be able to sell your Debenture Stock before the end of their term.How you can get your money out early The obligations of the Company to Investors in respect of the Debenture Stock are secured by a security interest in all the Company's Personal Property and a charge over the Company's Other Property pursuant to the Trust Deed granted by the Company in favour of the Supervisor.

The financial position and performance of the Company are essential to an assessment of the Company’s ability to meet its obligations under the Debenture Stock.

Details of these requirements and how to access information showing how the Company is meeting them are set out in Section 5 of this PDS.Where you can find Finance Direct’s financial information? Investments in debt securities have risks. A key risk is that the Company does not meet its commitments to repay you or pay you interest (credit risk). Section 6 of the PDS (Risks of Investing) discusses the main factors that give rise to the risk. You should consider if the credit risk of these debt securities is suitable for you.   The interest rates for the Debenture Stock should also reflect the degree of credit risk. In general, higher returns are demanded by Investors from businesses with a higher risk of defaulting on their commitments. You need to decide whether the offer is fair.Key risks affecting this investment  PAGE 4 Product Disclosure Statement The Company considers that the most significant risks factors are: As with most finance companies, the most significant risk faced by the Company is the risk that the Company is unable to recover loans in full from those parties' borrowing funds from the Company. This may occur where borrowers to whom we have lent money are, due to their personal financial situation, unable to meet their loan obligations.DEBTOR RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its ongoing obligations. A risk exists that the Company could encounter difficulty in raising funds at short notice to meet its lending and repayment commitments due to the Company principally raising funds from the issue of Debenture Stock.LIQUIDITY RISK The Company advances funds via the Platform on equal terms with other retail and wholesale investors on that Platform. When Finance Direct invests in a loan on the Platform a larger investment in lower-yielding loans will mean the margins the Company earns on these loans will be at a low level when compared to its cost of funds. This situation could have a significant impact on the income we receive. This may increase the risk of default if our interest rate margins reduce profitability and impact on our ability to make our payment obligations under the Debenture Stock.INTEREST RATE RISK As at 30 September 2022, approximately 20% of the Company's loans were secured by way of an agreement to mortgage over real estate owned by the borrower, which agreement is supported by a caveat registered against the certificate of title for the borrower's property. Adverse investments in the property market can therefore expose the Company to the risk of not receiving the full amount from those borrowersREAL ESTATE AND PROPERTY MARKET This summary does not cover all the risks of investing in the Debenture Stock.

The Company's loans can generally be categorised as falling within the following three categories: Loans are predominantly secured with first or second ranking registered security interests over motor vehicles, boats, and agreements to mortgage real estate (supported by caveats registered over the relevant real estate) owned by the borrower.  During the term of a loan, the underlying security for a particular loan may be lost due to the secured property being destroyed or disposed of illegally, i.e. in the case of a motor vehicle or a boat. To mitigate this risk, additional second ranking security is taken in some instances. This second ranking security interest is predominantly an agreement to mortgage real estate, which agreement is supported by a caveat over the real estate in question and which ranks behind an existing registered mortgage over the property in favour of the borrower's principal lender. Some general features of this lending are as follows:  The Company's loan documentation allows for loans to be varied during the course of the loan facility agreement. This includes the ability to extend the repayment date of loans and the rollover of loans into new agreements, where it is deemed beneficial to do so.

To mitigate this risk, additional second ranking security is taken in some instances. This second ranking security interest is predominantly an agreement to mortgage real estate, which agreement is supported by a caveat over the real estate in question and which ranks behind an existing registered mortgage over the property in favour of the borrower's principal lender. Some general features of this lending are as follows:  The Company's loan documentation allows for loans to be varied during the course of the loan facility agreement. This includes the ability to extend the repayment date of loans and the rollover of loans into new agreements, where it is deemed beneficial to do so. Loan rollovers are considered based on their individual merits, bearing in mind the current economic climate and the additional period of time required to achieve recovery of the loan. All loan rollovers are assessed based on current credit policy and require in-depth risk analysis, credit checking, security valuations, and third-party guarantees (where applicable) to be provided by borrowers.

PAGE 13 Product Disclosure StatementSection 5: Finance Direct’s financial information  The Company is required by law and its Trust Deed to meet certain financial requirements.  This table shows how the Company is currently meeting those requirements.   Tables showing how the Company is currently meeting those requirements are available on the Disclose Register at https://disclose-register.companiesoffice.govt.nz under the name “Finance Direct Limited” and are incorporated into this document by reference. These are minimum requirements.  Meeting them does not mean that the Company is safe.  The section on specific risks relating to the Company’s creditworthiness sets out risk factors that could cause its financial position to deteriorate.  The Disclose Register provides a breakdown of how the figures in the tables in the Disclose Register are calculated, as well as full financial statements. A copy of the financial statements is available on the Disclose Register at: https://disclose-register.companiesoffice.govt.nz/.General The Disclose Register contains a table outlining the following key ratios for the most recent audited financial statements, interim financial statements and Quarterly Reports with updates at the end of each quarter.Key Ratios The capital ratio is a measure of the extent to which the Company is able to absorb losses without becoming insolvent.   The lower the capital ratio, the fewer financial assets the   Company has to absorb unexpected losses arising out of its business activities. CAPITAL RATIO Related party exposures are financial exposures that the Company has to related parties. A  related party is an entity that is related to the Company through common control or some other connection that may give the party influence over the Company (or the Company over the related party).

REAL ESTATE AND PROPERTY MARKET  PAGE 17 Product Disclosure Statementin the event that the conditions in the real estate market deteriorate materially causing a depreciation in real estate values, this may adversely impact on the value of the security underlying certain of the Company's loans which it may realise in the event that it is required to enforce its security; and in the event, the Company sought to enforce its securities through the registration of a mortgage and/or the exercise of the power of sale under that mortgage, then the Company's ability to realise the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property would be subject to the claims of any prior ranking security interest registered over the mortgaged property in question, i.e. a first or second mortgage or prior ranking caveat. Subject to the extent of the borrower's indebtedness at the time of enforcement, there may not be sufficient remaining funds available to repay the indebtedness of the borrower to the Company.Generally, the caveat registered to support the agreement to mortgage will be registered after a first and/or a second mortgage. As a consequence: the principal risk of loss in investing in loans through the Platform is non-payment of amounts owing by borrowers who enter into loan agreements under the Platform; operating the Platform requires a licence. This licence is subject to conditions and those conditions may be changed at the discretion of the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) from time to time. Any breaches of any licence condition or any changes to conditions may lead to action by the FMA or a change in the manner in which the Platform is operated. The FMA also has other supervisory powers over financial services market participants which it may exercise at any time; changes to law or regulation in this area may affect the way the Platform is able to operate; the highly automated nature of the Platform may make it an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.The Company invests funds in loans made through a peer-to-peer lending platform operated by a related party. There are several risks related to investing in the Platform.  These, in general terms, are: Finance Direct mitigates the ‘borrower default’ risks of using the Platform by lending over multiple loans (it diversifies its exposure) and does not lend to any related party. PEER-TO-PEER LENDING INVESTMENTS  Due to our size, we do not have internal IT personnel but rely on third parties to effectively manage technological infrastructure.  We also rely on a financial software programme from an external provider which is not designed specifically for Finance Direct.  The fact that we do not have our own internal IT personnel may, in circumstances where third-party providers default in the performance of their obligations, result in a loss of information or delays in recovering loan payments or meeting our obligations to Investors.  This may increase the risk of default on our payment obligations under the Debenture Stock.   This risk is managed by the Company’s data disaster recovery plans that include that all information is reliably backed up by reputable IT suppliers.   Another operational risk is a staff mistake or fraud.  Given we are not a large organisation, our staff are often responsible for a number of areas within the Company and its subsidiary company Lending Crowd Limited. This may increase the likelihood of errors.   To mitigate this risk, we apply internal control procedures including, where possible, separation of duties, external monthly accountant reconciliations, and 6 monthly audits by an approved auditor.

"OPERATIONAL RISK  PAGE 18 Product Disclosure StatementThe Company is subject to a number of regulatory requirements. Due to the fact that Lending Crowd Limited (a subsidiary, and a related party, of the Company) operates a licenced peer-to-peer service, the Company is indirectly subject to a higher level of compliance and regulatory requirements compared to other non-bank deposit takers. These requirements involve substantial human resources to ensure ongoing compliance (as noted under ‘Operational risk’ above, our staff are often also responsible for operational matters that relate to our subsidiary Lending Crowd Limited).  Given we are not a large organisation, there may be an increased risk that we do not comply fully with all of the regulatory requirements which apply to us.  This might result in us being fined or sanctioned by either the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Financial Markets Authority or other regulatory body, and we could suffer damage to our reputation as a result.  This could disrupt the business operations and profitability and significantly increase the risk of default in our payment obligations under the Debenture Stock.  To mitigate these risks, we have internal control procedures and risk management policies. The Company also makes use of external specialists, including HLB Mann Judd for accounting matters and MinterEllisonRuddWatts for legal matters.REGULATORY RISK  PAGE 19 Product Disclosure StatementSection 7: Tax An investment in Debenture Stock will have taxation consequences. The effect of taxation will vary according to each Investor’s personal circumstances and there may be other tax consequences from acquiring or disposing of Debenture Stock that are not covered here. In particular, there may be different tax rules relating to you if you are a non-resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. Prospective Investors and Investors are encouraged to obtain independent professional advice on their personal tax circumstances and the possible effect on their personal tax circumstances of being an Investor of the Company.  Under current legislation, the Company is generally required to deduct resident withholding tax (RWT) from interest paid to, or applied for, the benefit of New Zealand resident Investors and Investors who hold secured deposits through a fixed establishment in New Zealand in which the Investors are engaged in business in New Zealand.

"OPERATIONAL RISK  PAGE 18 Product Disclosure StatementThe Company is subject to a number of regulatory requirements. Due to the fact that Lending Crowd Limited (a subsidiary, and a related party, of the Company) operates a licenced peer-to-peer service, the Company is indirectly subject to a higher level of compliance and regulatory requirements compared to other non-bank deposit takers. These requirements involve substantial human resources to ensure ongoing compliance (as noted under ‘Operational risk’ above, our staff are often also responsible for operational matters that relate to our subsidiary Lending Crowd Limited).  Given we are not a large organisation, there may be an increased risk that we do not comply fully with all of the regulatory requirements which apply to us.  This might result in us being fined or sanctioned by either the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Financial Markets Authority or other regulatory body, and we could suffer damage to our reputation as a result.  This could disrupt the business operations and profitability and significantly increase the risk of default in our payment obligations under the Debenture Stock.  To mitigate these risks, we have internal control procedures and risk management policies.
