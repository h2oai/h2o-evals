#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What are some factors that institutions should consider when determining the appropriate level of capital reserves to hold against the risk of default?

**Answer:** Institutions should consider several factors when determining the appropriate level of capital reserves to hold against the risk of default, including the creditworthiness of the borrower, the type and term of the credit, the collateral or guarantees provided, and the economic and market conditions.
