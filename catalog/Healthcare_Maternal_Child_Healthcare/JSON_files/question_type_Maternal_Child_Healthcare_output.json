The leading causes of maternal mortality are hemorrhage, infection, unsafe abortion, and eclampsia. Unsafe abortion can be caused by demographic risk factors such as young age, high parity, and lack of access to contraception and reproductive health information. In many developing countries, young boys and girls have less access to relevant information about reproductive health, and less or no access to contraception, leading to high rates of unsafe abortion. The legal status of abortion also impacts access to safe abortion care, with 25% of the world population living in countries where induced abortion is prohibited except to save the life of the pregnant woman or without explicit exception. In contrast, 40% of the world population lives in countries where induced abortion is permitted on request of the woman, with many countries having gestational age limits. Elective abortion care has significant differences among countries, with some countries considering socio-medical factors or adverse social conditions as indicators for induced abortion. In developed countries, access to safe abortion care is more readily available, while in developing countries, lack of access to safe abortion care is a major problem, leading to high rates of unsafe abortion."

In contrast, hormonal methods like the pill have a higher risk of side effects such as blood clots and stroke. The benefits and risks of each method must be carefully weighed, and counseling by family planning providers can help reduce the risks. Family planning programs should provide a range of methods to meet varying family planning needs throughout the life cycle and for both women and men, and access to services should be available in both public and private health facilities and through community-based distribution networks.

Topics such as ARI in children, child abuse, and sexual violence are not included in the lecture notes but can be covered through assignments and group discussions. To address these limitations, future revisions of the lecture notes could consider expanding the content to cover more topics, or providing additional resources for students to explore these issues further."

Eclampsia can also result in fetal death or the birth of a premature infant at high risk of death. To prevent eclampsia, it is important to detect and manage pre-eclampsia early, which can be done through regular prenatal care, monitoring of blood pressure, and community education to recognize the danger signs. Immediate transfer and treatment, including expedited delivery, are also crucial in case of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia."
