"FOREWORD BY THE MINISTERIt gives me great pleasure to present the 2021/22 Annual Report of the Department  of Home Affairs (DHA). The report reflects our efforts towards the realisation of our  vision of a South Africa where identity, status and citizenship are key enablers of citizen  empowerment and inclusivity, economic development and national security. DHA  enables socio-economic development and transformation. Because of this crucial role,  DHA enabling documents must have integrity.  As we conclude the third year of the 2019-2024 Medium-Term Strategic Framework  (MTSF) and the second year of the 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, I wish to underscore that the  DHA remained resolute in delivering its constitutional mandate under very difficult as  the globe started to emerge from the impact by the COVID-19 pandemic. We embraced  the new normal as we remained unwavering in our determination to build a society that  is founded on equality, non-discrimination and human dignity. In giving effect to our  mandate, we continued to be guided by our constitutional and international obligations,  the National Development Plan (NDP), MTSF priorities of government and departmental  priorities – including the performance agreements the Deputy Minister and I signed with  the President.  The programmes of the department were geared towards improving service delivery,  securing the population register while, at the same time, enabling access to identification,  status, immigration and citizenship services to qualifying citizens and residents. This  enabled the department to contribute to the MTSF priorities of government. The DHA  contributes directly to 2 of the 7 MTSF priorities; that is, priority 2 (Economic Transformation  and Job Creation) and 6 (Social Cohesion and Safe Communities). However, through our  mandate, we contribute indirectly to all priorities. For instance, through the International  Migration mandate, we contribute to priority 7: A better Africa and World. During the 2021/22 financial year our work was guided by the following key priorities: • Establishment of an effective Border Management Authority (BMA); • Completion of the modernisation programme; • Facilitating the importation of critical skills and tourism into South Africa through a  risk-based and strategic approach to immigration. In this regard, a new Critical Skills  List was gazetted; Dr Pakishe Aaron Motsoaledi, MP  Minister of Home Affairs11 ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022• Upgrading and redevelopment of the six (6) key land ports of entry to One-Stop  Border posts; • Early birth registration (including expanding connectivity at health facilities); • Accelerated rollout of the smart ID card to all eligible persons; • Repositioning of the DHA as a secure and modern department that is located within  the security system of the State; • War on queues; • Access and footprint development to improve the reach of DHA services, including  purpose-fit DHA physical infrastructure and mobile offices; As we reflect and give account of our performance for the 2021/22 financial year, we will  highlight priority areas where we have done well and where we have fallen short.  In the 2021/22 financial year, the department achieved 69% of its APP targets, which is  a slight improvement on the 68% performance of the previous year. In numerical terms,  this translates to achieving 20 out of the 29 APP targets set for the year under review.  In the 2021/22 financial year the department operated under very difficult conditions.  The adjustment to the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to have a negative  impact on service delivery operations and performance though at a lesser extent when  compared to the previous financial year. The immigration services performance was  directly impacted by the disruption of services and capacitation of staff as a result of  reduced operating conditions under Covid-19 State of Disaster.  Two critical immigration  services were not offered for the most part of the 2021/2022 financial year.

The Refugee Reception Offices remained  closed during this reporting period and registration and processing of newcomers was  suspended. The civic services environment was also severely affected. The service delivery sphere  and performance of the branch were impacted on by second and third waves of the  virus which were characterised by abrupt office closures and limited access to health  facilities. As lockdown levels eased, additional services were resumed. But the abrupt  office closures resulted in backlogs in certain areas, overcrowding in offices and inability  to service all clients in a day. The largest threat facing the operational environment during  the review period was the reduction of human capital at local offices. Between April 2021 and March 2022, 155-line function posts were vacated and could not be filled due to  acute funding shortages. Despite this constraining operating environment, civic services  managed to achieve its targets. This was, to a large extent, made possible by the scenario  targeting approach which was aligned to lockdown levels and availability of staff. The “War on Queues” programme remained a priority for the department during the  period under review. Whilst our efforts may have been temporarily deterred by Covid 19  with imposed staff and operational limitations, we continue to place focus on reducing  long queues and improving turnaround / response times. Key interventions that are  aimed at eradicating queues in our offices include the piloting of Branch Appointment  Booking Systems (BABS) in all offices that can process Smart ID Cards and passports; and  inclusion of seven offices the Presidential Infrastructure Priorities offices. They include:  Mthatha Office Large Office, Gqeberha Large Office, Bloemfontein Large Office, Byron  Place/ Pretoria Large Office, Pinetown Medium Office, Polokwane Large Office; and  Johannesburg Large Office. BABS was piloted in 25 of our busiest offices in the 2021/22 financial year. The department  continued to receive positive feedback from the clients and, for this reason, we will be  rolling out the system to more offices and also run a campaign to increase awareness. In 2019/20 financial year, the Department embarked on a large-scale project to roll-out  online birth registration system in 1445 public health facilities with maternity wards as  part of the Early Birth Registration Strategy to register children within 30 days of birth.  The ultimate goal of the project is to capacitate health facilities with maternity wards to  ensure that births are registered where they occur and that all children born in health  these health facilities leave with a birth certificate. Out of the 1445 public health facilities  where births are delivered, approximately 85% of births are delivered in 251 health  facilities and it is the desire of the department to make sure that every birth that takes  place in these 251 facilities is registered before the parents leave the health centres. To  date the department has managed to have a presence in 160 health facilities which  are responsible for only 63% of births delivered. The department has not been able to  complete the remaining 91 facilities responsible for 22% of birth occurrence due to lack  of resource. In the next financial year, the department will submit a business case to  National Treasury to request additional funding for the funding of the remaining health  facilities and also look at self-financing.12 DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRSThe department had a very busy policy and legislative programme that seeks to replace  a piecemeal approach of amending legislation with a comprehensive review of the  department’s mandatory legislation. The following policy and legislative work is worth  noting: • White Paper on Marriages: The Department undertook extensive consultations within  and outside government on the Green Paper on Marriages which was gazetted for  public comments in April 2021. The Department received more than 1000 submission  from the public as well as from the stakeholders.

The following policy and legislative work is worth  noting: • White Paper on Marriages: The Department undertook extensive consultations within  and outside government on the Green Paper on Marriages which was gazetted for  public comments in April 2021. The Department received more than 1000 submission  from the public as well as from the stakeholders.

"Two critical immigration  services were not offered for the most part of the 2021/2022 financial year. This refers  to Permanent Residence Applications and Permanent Residence Appeals were only  re-introduced with effect 1 January 2022. The Refugee Reception Offices remained  closed during this reporting period and registration and processing of newcomers was  suspended. The civic services environment was also severely affected. The service delivery sphere  and performance of the branch were impacted on by second and third waves of the  virus which were characterised by abrupt office closures and limited access to health  facilities. As lockdown levels eased, additional services were resumed. But the abrupt  office closures resulted in backlogs in certain areas, overcrowding in offices and inability  to service all clients in a day. The largest threat facing the operational environment during  the review period was the reduction of human capital at local offices. Between April 2021 and March 2022, 155-line function posts were vacated and could not be filled due to  acute funding shortages. Despite this constraining operating environment, civic services  managed to achieve its targets. This was, to a large extent, made possible by the scenario  targeting approach which was aligned to lockdown levels and availability of staff. The “War on Queues” programme remained a priority for the department during the  period under review. Whilst our efforts may have been temporarily deterred by Covid 19  with imposed staff and operational limitations, we continue to place focus on reducing  long queues and improving turnaround / response times. Key interventions that are  aimed at eradicating queues in our offices include the piloting of Branch Appointment  Booking Systems (BABS) in all offices that can process Smart ID Cards and passports; and  inclusion of seven offices the Presidential Infrastructure Priorities offices. They include:  Mthatha Office Large Office, Gqeberha Large Office, Bloemfontein Large Office, Byron  Place/ Pretoria Large Office, Pinetown Medium Office, Polokwane Large Office; and  Johannesburg Large Office. BABS was piloted in 25 of our busiest offices in the 2021/22 financial year. The department  continued to receive positive feedback from the clients and, for this reason, we will be  rolling out the system to more offices and also run a campaign to increase awareness. In 2019/20 financial year, the Department embarked on a large-scale project to roll-out  online birth registration system in 1445 public health facilities with maternity wards as  part of the Early Birth Registration Strategy to register children within 30 days of birth.  The ultimate goal of the project is to capacitate health facilities with maternity wards to  ensure that births are registered where they occur and that all children born in health  these health facilities leave with a birth certificate. Out of the 1445 public health facilities  where births are delivered, approximately 85% of births are delivered in 251 health  facilities and it is the desire of the department to make sure that every birth that takes  place in these 251 facilities is registered before the parents leave the health centres. To  date the department has managed to have a presence in 160 health facilities which  are responsible for only 63% of births delivered.

The Green Paper was revised and  submitted with concrete policy proposal to Cabinet as a draft White Paper. In March  2022 Cabinet approved the White Paper as a policy framework that will guide the  development of a new single legislation that will regulate all marriages in SA. In the  2022/23 financial year the department will be drafting a new marriage legislation  for submission to Cabinet. Once enacted, the new Marriage Act will enable South  Africans and residents of different sexual orientation, religious and cultural persuasions  to conclude legal marriages that will accord with the principle of equality, non- discrimination and human dignity as encapsulated in the Constitution of RSA. The  new legislation will also outlaw child marriages; that is marriage of any person who is  younger than 18 years.  • One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) Policy: Subsequent to the gazetting of the OSBP policy  in December 2020, the department conducted extensive consultation with various  stakeholders and NEDLAC. In March 2022 Cabinet approved the policy as a policy  framework that will guide the development of a new legislation that will regulate the  establishment and management of OSBPs in SA. The policy will enable the drafting of  the OSBP Act that will make provision for the performance of border law enforcement  functions by the SA officials extraterritorially and border officials of our neighbouring  countries to exercise similar jurisdiction on the South African soil. • In March 2022 Cabinet further approved the Official Identity Management (OIM)  Policy as the new policy that will guide the drafting of a new Identification legislation. In the 2021/22 financial year, at the request of the National Assembly, the department  initiated the process of amending the Electoral Act 73 of 1998. This amendment was  necessitated by the Constitutional Court Judgement. In the New Nation Movement NPC and Others v the President of South Africa matter, the Constitutional Court declared that  “the Electoral Act 73 of 1998 is unconstitutional to the extent that it requires that adult  citizens may be elected to the National Assembly (NA) and Provincial Legislatures (PLs)  only through their membership of political parties” . The Constitutional Court directed  Parliament to rectify the defective sections of the Electoral law within a period of 24  months; that is, from June 2020 to June 2022.  Pursuant to the Constitutional Court judgement and subsequent consultations between  the National Assembly (NA) and the Executive, I established the Ministerial Advisory  Committee (MAC) in February 2021 to help develop policy options on the electoral  system that address the defects of the Electoral Act 1998. The MAC carried out its business  through public hearings, comprehensive review and analysis of existing literature and  documents submitted by think tanks and other stakeholders on South Africa’s electoral  system and electoral systems on the African continent and beyond.  The MAC proposed two options; that is, the minimalist model and mixed-member  model. In one hand, the minimalist model entails modifying the existing multi-member  electoral system to accommodate independent candidates in the national and provincial  elections without many changes in the legislation, including not interfering with the  constitutionally required general proportionality. On the other hand, the mixed-member  model entails combining the first-past-the-post and proportional representation, making  it a mixed-member proportional (MMP) system resembling the current local government  electoral system, albeit with some improvements. This option involves electing MPs from  200 single-member constituencies and the remainder from a single national multi- member constituency. Cabinet approved the minimalist model which informed the  drafting of the Electoral Amendment Bill which was tabled in Parliament on 1 December  2021 to enable public consultations.

In the New Nation Movement NPC and Others v the President of South Africa matter, the Constitutional Court declared that  “the Electoral Act 73 of 1998 is unconstitutional to the extent that it requires that adult  citizens may be elected to the National Assembly (NA) and Provincial Legislatures (PLs)  only through their membership of political parties” . The Constitutional Court directed  Parliament to rectify the defective sections of the Electoral law within a period of 24  months; that is, from June 2020 to June 2022.  Pursuant to the Constitutional Court judgement and subsequent consultations between  the National Assembly (NA) and the Executive, I established the Ministerial Advisory  Committee (MAC) in February 2021 to help develop policy options on the electoral  system that address the defects of the Electoral Act 1998. The MAC carried out its business  through public hearings, comprehensive review and analysis of existing literature and  documents submitted by think tanks and other stakeholders on South Africa’s electoral  system and electoral systems on the African continent and beyond.  The MAC proposed two options; that is, the minimalist model and mixed-member  model. In one hand, the minimalist model entails modifying the existing multi-member  electoral system to accommodate independent candidates in the national and provincial  elections without many changes in the legislation, including not interfering with the  constitutionally required general proportionality. On the other hand, the mixed-member  model entails combining the first-past-the-post and proportional representation, making  it a mixed-member proportional (MMP) system resembling the current local government  electoral system, albeit with some improvements. This option involves electing MPs from  200 single-member constituencies and the remainder from a single national multi- member constituency. Cabinet approved the minimalist model which informed the  drafting of the Electoral Amendment Bill which was tabled in Parliament on 1 December  2021 to enable public consultations. Since the promulgation of the BMA Act 2 of 2000, notable progress has been made towards  the establishment of the BMA",What is the current status of the Electoral Amendment Bill?,"['The Bill has been tabled in Parliament for public consultations.', ""The Bill has been passed by Parliament and is awaiting the President's signature."", 'The Bill has been withdrawn due to public outcry.', 'The Bill has been rejected by Cabinet.']",0,SA_Home_Affairs.pdf

Since the promulgation of the BMA Act 2 of 2000, notable progress has been made towards  the establishment of the BMA. This includes the signing of a BMA Commencement  proclamation by the President which allows for the appointment of a Commissioner  and Deputy Commissioner for the BMA. On that account, a Commissioner and two  Deputy Commissioners have been appointed to lead the process of implementing and  rolling out the BMA. In the 2022/23 financial year, the Department is going to embark 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022on a recruitment drive to fill strategic positions in the BMA. The BMA Border Guard will  be capacitated and deployed at identified ports of entry and within the border law  enforcement area. I have signed a delegation of authority to the BMA Commissioner in  respect of the transfer of frontline immigration functions and personnel at ports of entry.  The Section 97 proclamations by means of which the frontline functions would have been  transferred into the BMA was not finalised as concurrence on e.g. the health functions  was not received. The Minister for Public Works and Administration has assigned interim  custodial powers, duties and responsibilities to the Minister of Home Affairs for Oshoek,  Lebombo, Ficksburg and Maseru ports of entry. In the 2022/23 financial year, the department plans to roll out the BMA at 46 ports of  entry by incorporating frontline Immigration, Port Health, Agriculture and Access Control  functions into the BMA. Despite the increasing demand for our services, the DHA continues to be under  capacitated. As at 31 March 2022, the staff compliment consisted of 8 277 employees,  while the approved structure provides for 19 886 posts. To address the capacity  challenges experienced by the department, a capacitation business case was developed,  with a focus on core business. The business case was submitted to National Treasury on  18 October 2021. National Treasury approved the business case and allocated additional  funding on 28 January 2022. The funding provided by Nation Treasury will bring relief as it  allows for the funding of more than 750 posts, with preference being given to lower level  staff at front line offices in the Civic Services and Immigration Branches. These posts will  be filled in the new financial year. The funded business case capacitation will move the  department from 41. 6% to 45.4% staff complement.   We continue to aggressively fight crime, fraud and corruption within and outside of the  Department. We are arresting our officials, persons wishing to fraudulently secure South  African passports, IDs or other enabling documents and South Africans who sell their  identity.  The department is serious about rooting out fraud and corruption. The zero tolerance  campaign against fraud and corruption is not mere words, as evidenced by the numerous  arrests and dismissals as reported in the media.In 2021, I launched a Task Team to review the issuance of permits. This Task Team has  presented a report which was presented in Parliament. The Task Team found numerous  areas where fraud was taking place. This financial year, the Department is focused on  implementing the recommendations of the Task Team.  I would like to thank our officials and partners who have enabled the department to  achieve 69 % of its APP targets under very difficult conditions.

"_________________ Dr P A Motsoaledi, MP Minister of Home Affairs Date: 14 DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS4. DEPUTY MINISTER STATEMENTIn one of the largest demonstrations staged in this country’s history, about 20 000 women  of all races marched to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956, to present a petition  against the carrying of passes by women. This was a march against the unjust laws of  the then repressive State. Through the introduction of the passes for African women,  the apartheid government restricted their movement and designated specific areas to  live, work and travel. African women were required to carry and produce their “pass” at  all times. In the petition women exclaimed, “We shall not rest until ALL pass laws and all  forms of permits restricting our freedom have been abolished. We shall not rest until we  have won for our children their fundamental rights of freedom, justice, and security” . It is  this fundamental right that every employee of the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is  constitutionally mandated to defend for all persons who live in the country irrespective  of their races, sex, sex orientation, gender, religion and culture.  The DHA is at the centre of eliminating the “scandal of invisibility”; that is, through our  mandate we ensure that no one, irrespective of their status, is left behind without a  legal record of existence. The DHA is the only institution of the State that safeguards a  person’s legal record of existence from the cradle to the grave. Only the DHA can register  a birth, affirm a person’s identity and issue a South African identity document, passport  and marriage and death certificates. No other department can affirm or grant citizenship  and issue visas or permits to qualifying non-citizens. The DHA is also at the centre of  safeguarding the sovereignty and national security of the State. That is, the sovereignty  of any State is at risk if it does not know who its citizens are. It also cannot provide  adequate protection to foreign nationals as prescribed in domestic law and international  commitments if it does not know the identity and purpose of other nationals entering  and leaving the country. It is for this reason that during the 2021/22 financial year the DHA continued to provide  its mandatory services whilst maintaining a balance to the adherence of Covid-19  regulations. This report is an account of how the DHA has performed towards the  realisation of its exclusive mandate which is to determine and affirm the official identity  and status of all citizens and non-citizens who reside in South Africa.  In the 2021/22 financial year, the Department received an allocation of R9. 431 billion.  The allocation for 2021/22 shows a marginal increase of 7.3% compared to the previous  Mr. N Nzuza, MP  Deputy Minister of Home Affairs15 ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022financial year. The department utilised its resources to, among other things, give new  born children their first form of identity and belonging to our great nation. In the 2020/21  financial year, we made good progress towards the universal early birth registration,  which is a key responsibility of government and an essential component of security,  good governance and sound administration. Furthermore, the optimisation of early birth  registration is aligned to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 16, which  is aimed at providing access to justice, ending the scandal of invisibility, statelessness,  trafficking of children and providing legal identity for all, including birth registration by  2030. The Department continued its venture to ensure that all births are timeously registered  and that no child’s birth is left not registered in South Africa. To optimise birth registration,  the Department continued to improve connectivity at health centres through its  increased footprint plan as per the Birth Optimisation Strategy. When the National  Development Plan (NDP) was launched in 2012, South Africa’s rate of birth registration  was at 83%. The DHA has since improved its status to 85% since 2014.   During the 2021/22 financial year the department set a target of registering 750 000  births within 30 calendar days. The department managed to register 1 016 684 births, of  which 751 025 were births registered within 30 calendar days.

Furthermore, the optimisation of early birth  registration is aligned to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 16, which  is aimed at providing access to justice, ending the scandal of invisibility, statelessness,  trafficking of children and providing legal identity for all, including birth registration by  2030. The Department continued its venture to ensure that all births are timeously registered  and that no child’s birth is left not registered in South Africa. To optimise birth registration,  the Department continued to improve connectivity at health centres through its  increased footprint plan as per the Birth Optimisation Strategy. When the National  Development Plan (NDP) was launched in 2012, South Africa’s rate of birth registration  was at 83%. The DHA has since improved its status to 85% since 2014.

"_________________ Dr P A Motsoaledi, MP Minister of Home Affairs Date: 14 DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS4. DEPUTY MINISTER STATEMENTIn one of the largest demonstrations staged in this country’s history, about 20 000 women  of all races marched to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956, to present a petition  against the carrying of passes by women. This was a march against the unjust laws of  the then repressive State. Through the introduction of the passes for African women,  the apartheid government restricted their movement and designated specific areas to  live, work and travel. African women were required to carry and produce their “pass” at  all times. In the petition women exclaimed, “We shall not rest until ALL pass laws and all  forms of permits restricting our freedom have been abolished. We shall not rest until we  have won for our children their fundamental rights of freedom, justice, and security” . It is  this fundamental right that every employee of the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is  constitutionally mandated to defend for all persons who live in the country irrespective  of their races, sex, sex orientation, gender, religion and culture.  The DHA is at the centre of eliminating the “scandal of invisibility”; that is, through our  mandate we ensure that no one, irrespective of their status, is left behind without a  legal record of existence. The DHA is the only institution of the State that safeguards a  person’s legal record of existence from the cradle to the grave. Only the DHA can register  a birth, affirm a person’s identity and issue a South African identity document, passport  and marriage and death certificates. No other department can affirm or grant citizenship  and issue visas or permits to qualifying non-citizens. The DHA is also at the centre of  safeguarding the sovereignty and national security of the State. That is, the sovereignty  of any State is at risk if it does not know who its citizens are. It also cannot provide  adequate protection to foreign nationals as prescribed in domestic law and international  commitments if it does not know the identity and purpose of other nationals entering  and leaving the country. It is for this reason that during the 2021/22 financial year the DHA continued to provide  its mandatory services whilst maintaining a balance to the adherence of Covid-19  regulations. This report is an account of how the DHA has performed towards the  realisation of its exclusive mandate which is to determine and affirm the official identity  and status of all citizens and non-citizens who reside in South Africa.  In the 2021/22 financial year, the Department received an allocation of R9. 431 billion.  The allocation for 2021/22 shows a marginal increase of 7.3% compared to the previous  Mr. N Nzuza, MP  Deputy Minister of Home Affairs15 ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022financial year.

In the 2021/22 financial  year, the plan was to optimise birth registrations at health facilities, immediately after  birth has occurred.  The positive impact of the health facilities is demonstrated by the  42.3% of births registered in 2021/2022 which were done at health facilities which is an  increase from 33.4% in 2020/2021. We anticipate that the numbers of birth registration in  health facilities will increase in the new financial year. We continued with our efforts to issue Smart ID cards to our citizens. By the end of  2021/2022 financial year, more than 19 million South African citizens had been issued  with smart ID cards. The replacement of the old green barcoded ID books with the new  smart ID cards initiated in 2013, remains on track, with milestones set for each year. During  the 2021/2022 financial year, we issued a total of 2 369 245 smart ID cards surpassing  the targeted 1,6 Million. This was despite the limitations imposed on operations by the  Covid-19 pandemic and its management and preventative measures. Of the smart ID  cards issued, 966 068 were for first-time applicants comprising mainly of the youth. It is a significant improvement compared to the 622 539 issued to first time applicants in the  previous financial year. It is indicative of the impact we are making in the lives of young  people of our country.  In the 2021/2022 the Department procured additional 10 mobile units in addition to  100 mobile units which also provide support to high volume offices and offices under  distress. Through the mobile units the Department is better placed to reach out to areas  where there is little or no Home Affairs footprint, especially in rural and remote areas.  The mobile units are also the backbone of the department’s school Smart ID Campaign  which has benefited both urban and rural school. Using mobile units, we have been  able to target learners ensuring that South African learners doing grade 12 sit for their  examinations already in possession of a Smart ID Card. We have now also placed focus  to grade 11 which saw the number of learners starting their grade 12 without identity  documents reduced from 8 187 in 2020 to 2 560 in 2021 academic year. In the period under review we visited 1011 schools working in partnership with the  Department of Basic Education. The additional mobile units purchased and the ones to  be purchased in the new financial year will extend our reach and greatly enhance our  school ID campaigns The pandemic has highlighted the need to fast-track innovation in respect to how we  render service delivery to our clients. as well as revolutionising our back office functions.  Many of our clients are already using the e-homeaffairs service channel launched in 2016,  allowing them to pay online, schedule an appointment, and apply for smart ID cards  and passports at 25 participating bank branches. Thus far, approximately 212 101 smart  ID cards and more than 222 406 passports have been obtained through the existing  participating branches and to a smaller extent at online offices, which is a huge success.  The DHA is working towards the finalisation of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with  the banking sector and National Treasury to roll this out across the country. The Department continued to experience system downtime which led to long queues  in our frontline offices.

We have now also placed focus  to grade 11 which saw the number of learners starting their grade 12 without identity  documents reduced from 8 187 in 2020 to 2 560 in 2021 academic year. In the period under review we visited 1011 schools working in partnership with the  Department of Basic Education. The additional mobile units purchased and the ones to  be purchased in the new financial year will extend our reach and greatly enhance our  school ID campaigns The pandemic has highlighted the need to fast-track innovation in respect to how we  render service delivery to our clients. as well as revolutionising our back office functions.  Many of our clients are already using the e-homeaffairs service channel launched in 2016,  allowing them to pay online, schedule an appointment, and apply for smart ID cards  and passports at 25 participating bank branches. Thus far, approximately 212 101 smart  ID cards and more than 222 406 passports have been obtained through the existing  participating branches and to a smaller extent at online offices, which is a huge success.  The DHA is working towards the finalisation of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with  the banking sector and National Treasury to roll this out across the country. The Department continued to experience system downtime which led to long queues  in our frontline offices. Our 2021-22 provincial report estimates that system downtime,  particularly on the live capture system, resulted in a production loss exceeding 682  business hours, or 28 business days. Under ordinary working conditions, the potential  number of applications missed due to downtimes is approximately 200 000.

"The DHA has since improved its status to 85% since 2014.   During the 2021/22 financial year the department set a target of registering 750 000  births within 30 calendar days. The department managed to register 1 016 684 births, of  which 751 025 were births registered within 30 calendar days. In the 2021/22 financial  year, the plan was to optimise birth registrations at health facilities, immediately after  birth has occurred.  The positive impact of the health facilities is demonstrated by the  42.3% of births registered in 2021/2022 which were done at health facilities which is an  increase from 33.4% in 2020/2021. We anticipate that the numbers of birth registration in  health facilities will increase in the new financial year. We continued with our efforts to issue Smart ID cards to our citizens. By the end of  2021/2022 financial year, more than 19 million South African citizens had been issued  with smart ID cards. The replacement of the old green barcoded ID books with the new  smart ID cards initiated in 2013, remains on track, with milestones set for each year. During  the 2021/2022 financial year, we issued a total of 2 369 245 smart ID cards surpassing  the targeted 1,6 Million. This was despite the limitations imposed on operations by the  Covid-19 pandemic and its management and preventative measures. Of the smart ID  cards issued, 966 068 were for first-time applicants comprising mainly of the youth. It is a significant improvement compared to the 622 539 issued to first time applicants in the  previous financial year. It is indicative of the impact we are making in the lives of young  people of our country.  In the 2021/2022 the Department procured additional 10 mobile units in addition to  100 mobile units which also provide support to high volume offices and offices under  distress.

It also highlighted the need for the  department to refocus itself as an organ within the security cluster and apparatus of the  state and to protect the sovereignty and constitutional rights of all citizens and visitors to  South Africa. This mandate has a bearing on the lives of every person within the country  – from the cradle to the grave! Overview of the operations of the department In comparison to the 2020/21 financial year, the operations of the department were less  affected by Covid as the country moved down through the lockdown levels and as more  services were rendered and staff returned to work. However, it has proven difficult to  return to pre-Covid levels of production and to get 100% of staff back at the office. Issues  such as co-morbidities, social distancing at the workplace, infrastructure constraints,  and remote working arrangements are difficult to manage and control.

This mandate has a bearing on the lives of every person within the country  – from the cradle to the grave! Overview of the operations of the department In comparison to the 2020/21 financial year, the operations of the department were less  affected by Covid as the country moved down through the lockdown levels and as more  services were rendered and staff returned to work. However, it has proven difficult to  return to pre-Covid levels of production and to get 100% of staff back at the office. Issues  such as co-morbidities, social distancing at the workplace, infrastructure constraints,  and remote working arrangements are difficult to manage and control. The department  nevertheless continued to provide essential services such as issuing birth and death  certificates, identity documents, and visas throughout all lockdown levels. This highlights  the critical role the department plays in government and society.   The department is organised into four programmes in accordance with the Estimates of  National Expenditure (ENE) for the vote: Home Affairs. The four programmes are: • Administration • Citizen Affairs  • Immigration Affairs • Institutional support and transfers Programme 1: Administration provides for strategic leadership, management and  support services to the department. It includes as sub programmes the Ministry,  corporate services, transversal information technology and office accommodation. From  a resourcing perspective, transversal information technology is allocated an annual  Mr. L. T. Makhode  Director-General   Department of Home Affairs18 DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRSbudget in excess of R1 billion. Office accommodation was allocated a budget of R582  million in the financial year under review. The purpose of Programme 2: Citizen Affairs is to provide secure, efficient and accessible  services and enabling documents to citizens and residents. The objectives are to ensure  that registration at birth is the only entry point to the population register; that the number  of smart ID cards issued per year increases year on year; and that the standard of service  delivery be maintained for the issuing of machine readable passports for adults within 13  working days and for children within 18 working days through the live capture system.  Service delivery through the front offices are coordinated at provincial level by provincial  managers. As this is the heart of the department, the budget allocated to the provinces  exceed R2 billion per annum. The purpose of Programme 3: Immigration Affairs is to facilitate and regulate the  secure movement of people through ports of entry into and out of the South Africa, to  determine the status of asylum seekers, and to regulate refugee affairs",What is the critical role that the Department of Home Affairs plays in government and society?,"['Issuing birth and death certificates, identity documents, and visas.', 'Providing secure, efficient, and accessible services and enabling documents to citizens and residents.', 'Facilitating and regulating the secure movement of people through ports of entry into and out of South Africa.', 'Determining the status of asylum seekers and regulating refugee affairs.']",1,SA_Home_Affairs.pdf

The purpose of Programme 3: Immigration Affairs is to facilitate and regulate the  secure movement of people through ports of entry into and out of the South Africa, to  determine the status of asylum seekers, and to regulate refugee affairs. The objectives  of this programme are to ensure that the standard of service delivery for processing  enabling documents are maintained by ensuring 85% of permanent residence  applications (processed and collected within South Africa for selected categories) are  adjudicated within 8 months; that 90% of business and general work visa applications  (processed and collected within South Africa) are adjudicated within 8 weeks; and that  95% of critical skills visa applications (collected with South Africa) are adjudicated within  4 weeks. Included under the sub-programme Immigration Services is the inspectorate  responsible for the detection, detention and deportation of illegal immigrants in terms  of the Immigration Act.  Programme 4: Institutional support and transfers provides institutional support and  transfer funds to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the Represented Political  Parties’ Fund and the Border Management Authority (BMA). On 21 July 2020 the  President assented to law the Border Management Act, 2020. The BMA Act provides  for the establishment of the BMA as a Schedule 3A public entity. The establishment of  the BMA follows on the recognition that border management is exercised by multiple  organs of State with the purpose of securing the borders of the Republic and protecting  our national interest. The BMA will play a key role in integrated and coordinated border  management and therefore deal effectively with the extent of illegal migration, potential  terrorist threats, porous borders, etc.The department is represented by its employees at 32 missions abroad. The department  is assisted by DIRCO employees on the agent principle basis at missions where the  department does not have a presence. The head of the mission, who is a DIRCO official, is  responsible for the overall management of the mission, including providing Home Affairs  services. DIRCO also collects revenue of behalf of the department at such missions and  must deposit such revenue directly into the National Revenue Fund (NRF). In addition,  the department uses the services of a visa facilitation company (VFS) to collect visa and  permit applications in some countries abroad, as well as within South Africa. As part of the Presidential economic stimulus package, the department continued to  roll-out the E-visa to countries which require visa to visit SA. The eVisa enables eligible  travellers to complete the online application forms in the comfort of their homes and  submit these to Home Affairs without visiting our missions abroad. The tourist module of  the e-Visa has been activated in 14 countries thus far, including China, India, Kenya and  Nigeria. The DHA will continue to streamline and modernise the visa application process  to make it easier to travel to South Africa for the purposes of tourism, business and work.  In 2022/23 financial year the department will focus on stabilizing the e-Visa system while  continuing to process clients (tourist visa) through the system. The Minister of Home Affairs has oversight of three statutory bodies: the Immigration  Advisory Board, the Refugee Appeals Board and the Standing Committee on Refugee  Affairs. The main responsibility of these bodies is to assist the department in discharging  its mandate in accordance with the Immigration Act, 2002, and the Refugees Act, 1998.

In quarter 4, the implementation of the IMS delegations on 12 January 2022 introduced a  manual process, parallel to the online VAS process.

The BMA SARS protocol has been signed and 10 port coordinators  were appointed.  The SANDF has provided a revised draft of the BMA Defence implementation protocol which will be finalised for  signature. 8 BMA incrementally rolled out to 11 ports of entry by  incorporating frontline immigration, port health, border facility  management and agriculture functions into the BMAThe Section 97 proclamations by means of which the frontline functions would have been incorporated into the BMA was not  finalised as concurrence on e.g. the health functions was not received. The Minister for Public Works and Administration has  assigned interim custodial powers, duties and responsibilities to the Minister of Home Affairs for Oshoek, Lebombo, Ficksburg and  Maseru ports of entry. 9 Financial and contractual closure reached with the appointed  bidders in respect of the redevelopment of six priority land  ports of entryThe TA IIA application to approve the request for proposal (RfP) document which will be issued to the market for bid responses  is under consideration by National Treasury. The information that was required as an input into the RfP had to be sourced from  various government departments and the process of sourcing the information was not as smooth as was anticipated. The  technical reports from studies commissioned by the DPWI were not provided to the transaction adviser on time. The expectation  is that Treasury will grant TA IIA approval in the first quarter of 2022/23.

It is therefore not only “what” services we deliver as government, but also “how” such  services are rendered that must be measured. To achieve this, the department will  introduce innovative mechanisms to reduce turnaround times and improve customer  satisfaction. In this regard. it is compelling for the department to render services in real- time, with predictability, and with assurance that systems are fully effective and robust  to avoid system downtimes, in a suitable working environment, and with a professional,  well trained staff compliment that really CARE.CHALLENGES The department continues to be beset with the same challenges as reported in previous  financial years. These are: • Network connectivity Systems stability is a non-negotiable outcome of our interventions as this resides as the  root cause of slow and ineffective service delivery. When systems are off-line, the live- capture environment for Civic Services is brought to a stand-still and services cannot be  rendered for that period of time. The department is hard at work with SITA, the mandatory  provider of technological solutions to government, to ensure that systems, networks and  enabling IT infrastructure are optimally deployed and maintained.  Leveraging technology integration is equally important to changing “how” services are  rendered. Our modernisation programme comprises key facets for improved execution  of our mandate through the development of applications that make it easier for a  client to interact with the department. Through the e-Home Affairs portal, clients can 22 DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRSnow make online applications for passports and ID cards using their banking platform,  with the department working closing with the commercial banking sector and BASA  to ensure rapid expansion of the departmental footprint and service offerings. Rural  communities are being serviced through the deployment of mobile units equipped with  satellite technology. In addition to the existing fleet of 100 mobile units, the department  procured and customised another 10 units in the year under review. More units will be  procured in the next financial year.  • Long queues The “War on Queues” remains a priority for the department. Whilst our efforts may have  been temporarily deterred by Covid 19 with imposed staff and operational limitations, we  continue to place focus on reducing long queues and improving turnaround / response  times. In this regard, we believe that the root cause of long queues will be addressed  by the following three strategic interventions: system stability, leveraging technology  integration and investment in our staff. With the onset of the Covid 19 pandemic, the  focus was on preventing long queues becoming ‘super-spreader’ events. While this focus  must not be lost, the new focus is on eliminating queues altogether and exceeding  customer expectations. Hands-on management, constant communication, and the  introduction of an appointment system for clients form key parts of this initiative. • Insufficient and poor office accommodation The department uses physical office space as the main delivery channel for its services.  Our offices are limited in number, some offices are poorly located, and most do not  meet the norms and standards set for modernised offices. As is the case with network  connectivity, the department is dependent upon the DPW&I to acquire and maintain  office space. Of the 412 departmental offices, 229 are leased from private landlords. Some  of these leases are on month to month, leaving landlords with little incentive to maintain  or upgrade their buildings. To reduce the cost and dependency on private landlords  and the DPW&I the department adopted the strategy to acquire stand alone, purpose  build facilities on state owned land with adequate parking and access as the basis for our  future accommodation needs.  Where offices had to be closed in accordance with the Covid-19 protocols, mobile units  were deployed to ensure service delivery interruptions are minimal",What is the department's goal in terms of service delivery?,"['To achieve 100% of its targets and obtain a clean audit outcome.', 'To meet the demands and expectations of its diverse clientele and stakeholders.', 'To render services in real-time, with predictability, and with assurance that systems are fully effective and robust.', 'To eliminate queues altogether and exceed customer expectations.']",1,SA_Home_Affairs.pdf

Whilst our efforts may have  been temporarily deterred by Covid 19 with imposed staff and operational limitations, we  continue to place focus on reducing long queues and improving turnaround / response  times. In this regard, we believe that the root cause of long queues will be addressed  by the following three strategic interventions: system stability, leveraging technology  integration and investment in our staff. With the onset of the Covid 19 pandemic, the  focus was on preventing long queues becoming ‘super-spreader’ events. While this focus  must not be lost, the new focus is on eliminating queues altogether and exceeding  customer expectations. Hands-on management, constant communication, and the  introduction of an appointment system for clients form key parts of this initiative. • Insufficient and poor office accommodation The department uses physical office space as the main delivery channel for its services.  Our offices are limited in number, some offices are poorly located, and most do not  meet the norms and standards set for modernised offices. As is the case with network  connectivity, the department is dependent upon the DPW&I to acquire and maintain  office space. Of the 412 departmental offices, 229 are leased from private landlords. Some  of these leases are on month to month, leaving landlords with little incentive to maintain  or upgrade their buildings. To reduce the cost and dependency on private landlords  and the DPW&I the department adopted the strategy to acquire stand alone, purpose  build facilities on state owned land with adequate parking and access as the basis for our  future accommodation needs.

Where offices had to be closed in accordance with the Covid-19 protocols, mobile units  were deployed to ensure service delivery interruptions are minimal. In addition, the  department is engaging the landlords of various malls throughout South Africa with  a view to relocate some of our offices into these malls. Some of these landlords have offered the department space for free or at significantly reduced rates. This is in addition  to other benefits such as easy access, convenience, and sufficient parking and security  being available. The department intends to pursue this option with vigour in the new  financial year. Proper and regular maintenance of our stock of office accommodation is problematic.  This leads to frequent injunctions issued for non-compliance to the prescribed OHS  standards. The department is engaging DPWI with a view to cede or assign to the  department the repair and maintenance responsibility.  • Capacity constraints Historically, the department has been insufficiently capacitated. For years, the department  could not replace staff as and when positions became vacant, given the Compensation of  Employee (COE) ceilings imposed by Treasury. As at 31 March 2022, the staff compliment  consisted of 8 277 “warm bodies” , while the approved structure provides for over 19  886 posts. The underfunding has, as a result, adversely affected the vacancy rate and  the capacity to deliver services. The high vacancy rate has led to reporting lines and  segregation of duty being compromised. This resulted in a ‘flat’ hierarchical structure that  compromises lines of accountability and responsibility” , thus creating a breeding ground  for errors, fraud and corruption. To address the capacity challenges experienced by the department, a capacitation  business case was developed, with a focus on core business. The business case was  submitted to National Treasury on 18 October 2021. Treasury considered the business  case favourably and allocated the following additional funding on 28 January 2022: 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 R266.953 million R278.832 million R291.352 million The funding provided by Treasury will bring relief as it allows for the funding of more than  750 posts, with preference being given to lower level staff at front line offices in the Civic  Services branch. These posts will be filled in the new financial year. The funded business  case capacitation will move the department from 41. 6% to 45.4% staff complement.   • Fraud and corruption Unfortunately, the operations of the department leave it vulnerable to criminal acts,  including fraud and corruption. Such action involves both our officials and persons  wishing to secure a South African passport, ID or other enabling documents. Actions 23 ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022range from voiding transactions on the tract and trace system to pocket the cash  received, armed robberies and break-ins, fraudulent issuing birth certificates, passports  and IDs, taking bribes, and granting visas and permits to non-qualifying foreign nationals.  The department is serious about rooting out fraud and corruption. The zero tolerance  campaign against fraud and corruption is not mere words, as evidenced by the  numerous arrests and dismissals as reported in the media. The 2021/22 financial year  saw unprecedented unearthing of corrupt elements in the department. Corrupt officials  and foreigners were nabbed in various operations by our Counter-Corruption officials in  collaboration with other law enforcement agencies. 60% of fraud and corruption cases  have to do with immigration issues, especially matters of permitting. Overview of the financial results of the department The department obtained its fifth unqualified audit opinion in the 2020/21 financial year.  This remains a remarkable achievement given the continued impact of Covid 19 on the  operating environment, reduced capacity, and system challenges. In what follows, the  annual appropriation, expenditure and revenue collected will be highlighted.   • Annual Appropriation Annual Appropriation - R9","What is the reason for the department's strategy to acquire standalone, purpose-built facilities?","['To reduce the cost and dependency on private landlords and the DPW&I.', 'To increase the capacity of the department and address vacancy challenges.', 'To improve the maintenance of office accommodation and comply with OHS standards.', 'To combat fraud and corruption within the department.']",0,SA_Home_Affairs.pdf

The increase of R644 million is mainly due  to additional funding of R562.2 million for self-financing expenditure incurred for issuing  official documents, which is defrayed by revenue generated from issuing the documents,  R40 million for the Independent Electoral Commission: Procurement of Personal Protective  Equipment and R138.8 million for Compensation of employees (COE) Adjustment: for the non-pensionable monthly cash allowance as per the PSCBC resolution. Therefore, in real  terms, the 2021/22 budget did not even cater for the rise in the inflation rate since the  previous year, while the demand for DHA services are increasing based on the growth in  the population as well as the number of foreign nationals in the country. The Department  has spent it’s allocated budget in full.  Following intense engagements with Treasury, and the submission of a capacitation  business case, the department was allocated the following additional funding over the  2022 medium term: • R837 million (R267 million in 2022/23, R279 million in 2023/24 and R291 million in  2024/25) for the capacitation of the department; and • R536 million (R171 million in 2022/23, R179 million in 2023/24 and R187 million in  2024/25) for the Represented Political Party Fund. The additional allocation for capacitation will go some way to relief pressure on staff as  the department intends to fill more than 750 posts in the incoming financial year.

This  programme includes the transfer payments to the IEC, the Representative Political  Parties Fund and the BMA. Previously the budget and expenditure relating to the transfer  payments to the IEC and Representative Political Parties Fund were recorded under  Programme 2: Citizen Affairs. This distorted the budget and expenditure picture of  Programme 2:  Citizen Affairs In terms of economic classification, the main cost drivers are compensation of employees  (COE), which costed the department R3, 667 billion (38.9%), followed by goods and  services at R2, 980 billion (31.5%), and transfers and subsidies at R2, 443 billion (25.9%), as  actual expenditure. Actual expenditure on payment for capital assets amounted to R331,  8 million (3.5%) in the year under review. The bulk of the actual expenditure on transfers  and subsidies is to the IEC and the Representative Political Parties Fund (R2, 417 billion).• Departmental receipts During the year under review, revenue collected increased significantly by approximately  R349 million (109%) to R719 million compared to the revenue collected in the previous  financial year of R370.9 million. Against the revenue target of R562 million for the  year under review, the target was exceeded by R156.5 million or 27.9%.
