This approach focuses on the usefulness of the work performed, rather than just the amount of money spent, and aligns with the broader trend of performance budgeting and zero-based budgeting. Additionally, the adoption of accrual accounting in the public sector is a result of governments developing more business-type functions and operating services on a commercial basis, which requires a more sophisticated accounting system that can accurately reflect the financial transactions proper to the period of the account."

In contrast, cash accounting only recognises transactions when cash is received or paid.

This approach also enables better management of financial resources, as it allows governments to plan and budget for future expenses and revenues.
