For instance, there has been a decline in the Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia rate and a drop in the yearly number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteraemia cases. Additionally, there has been a decline in the national rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections. Implementing the NSQHS Standards requires health service organisations to have integrated systems for clinical governance, partnering with consumers, and managing healthcare-associated infections, medication safety, comprehensive care, effective communication, blood management, and recognising and responding to acute deterioration. It is important for health service organisations to identify links between actions across the eight standards to ensure that their safety and quality systems are integrated and to reduce duplication of effort."
