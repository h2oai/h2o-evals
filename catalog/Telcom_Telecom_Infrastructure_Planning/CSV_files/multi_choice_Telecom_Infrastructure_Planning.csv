A/E contractor generated final  drawings and specifications for design -bid-build and d esign -build projects must  be stamped  by a BICSI  Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD).     Note: Design and construction may be concurrent efforts in Design- Build  projects, and multiple phases  of construction  may be approved. Therefore, the final  documents for each construction phase must be stamped.   2-1.1 Government -Designed Projects   On government -designed pr ojects (in -house design) the government designer must :  • Obtain  the approval of the service appointed telecommunications agent, prior  to bid, in accordance with regulations, policies, memorandums, and guidance.   • Ensure that the bid documents require an RCDD stamp on the contractor’s  telecommunications shop drawings submitted for approval.    2-1.2 Small Scale Projects   Small scale projects limited to adding work area outlet s from existing telecommunications  rooms do not require an RCDD stamp  provided the work is being accomplished under the  technical authority of an RCDD or the government telecommunications manager.   2-2 CLASSIFIED INFRASTRUCTURE   Classified Infrastructure is any infrastructure that is used to transmit unencrypted classified  National Security Information (NSI).

The TR may also function  as the telecommunications entrance facility .  2-4.1.3  Equipment Room (ER)   An equipment room (ER) is defined as an environmentally controlled , centralized space for  telecommunications equipment that usually houses a main or intermediate cross -connect.    Any or all of t he functions of a telecommunications room  or entrance facility  may be  provided by an equipment room .   2-4.1.4  Telecommunications Enclosure (TE)   A telecommunications enclosure (TE) is defined as a case or housing for telecommunications equipment, cable terminations, and cross -connect cabling.   Although TEs serve much in the same capacity as that of a TR, a TE must  not  replace a TR. The TE is also referred to as a Distributor Enclosure i n TIA -569-C. TEs must   meet the requirements for Distributor Enclosures in TIA -569-C.

Telecommunications spaces  must   be dedicated spaces not shared with other non- telecommunications functions (i.e.,  electrical rooms, mechanical rooms, plumbing, etc.).  When designing telecommunications  spaces , avoid locations that are restricted by building components that  may limit expan sion  such as elevators, outside walls, or other fixed building walls. Locate spaces  in an  accessible area of the building (e.g. common hallway) but limit access to personnel having  a telecommunications requirement or mission.  Accessibility for the deliver y of equipment  such as network switches, equipment racks and cabinets must  be provided. Locate t he  telecommunications space away from sources of electromagnetic interference or design the space  to mitigate the effects of this interference. Give s pecial att ention to electrical  power supply transformers, motors and generators, X -ray equipment, and radio or radar  transmitters.   In renovation projects, avoid rooms containing transformers, air handling units,  and similar equipment types if at all possible. If shared facilities cannot be avoided,  comply  with TIA -569-C and  maintain proper electrical/telecommunications cable separations  and  provide working clearances  per the National Electrical Code (NEC) .  2-4.2.2  Sizing and Quantity   Size ERs in accordance with TIA -568-C-1.1. Size each TR in accordance with TIA -568-C- 1.1, except that the minimum TR size for DoD buildings is  10 feet x 8 f eet (3m x 2.4m).   Generally, the TR should be sized to approximately 1.1 percent  of the area it serves.  For  example, a 10,000 sq f eet (929 sq m ) area should be served by a minimum of one 10 ft x  11 feet (3 m x 3.4 m) TR.  Divide large floor areas into “serving areas” with TRs for each  serving area. Each serving area can be no larger than 10,000 sq f eet (929 sq m) as  stipulated in TIA -568-C-1.1.  TR sizing, power, and HVAC requirements may be  substantially impacted if additional systems are required in the TR. Consult with the architectural designer or facilities engineer when additional systems requirements (audio visual systems, servers, disk storage arrays, etc.) are integrated int o the TR. Consider  utilizing an ER  for areas that exceed 10,000 sq f eet (929 sq m) or buildings that house  substantial I nformation Technology (IT)  electronics.   Provide a m inimum of one TR per  floor. Provide a ddition al rooms when the floor area is greater than 10,000 sq f eet (929 sq  m) and or the total cable distance to the outlet is over 295 f eet (90 m).

Utilize RG -6 coaxial cables for drops from the TR (or headend) to  the wall outlet.  Do not use RG -59 for CATV projects.   /1/    2-8.3 Wireless Access Points ( WAP)  When a wireless local area network (WLAN) system or a wireless intrusion detection  system (WIDS) is required,  design in accordance with TIA Telecommunications Systems  Bulletin 162- A (TSB -162-A) Telecommunications Cabling Guidelines for Wireless Access  Points.  TSB-162-A recommends the use of category 6A (or higher) twisted- pair and OM3  (or higher) optical  fiber cabling to support higher data rates and, in the case of twisted- pair  cabling, lower temperature rise when remote power is applied.  However the determination  of whether a Category 6A  (or higher) twisted- pair or OM3 (or higher) optical fiber cabling is  used must be based on the following:     • Complexity of maintaining multiple cabling systems (Category 6 for work area outlets and Category 6A or optical fiber for support of WAPs)   • Funding constraints to procure and maintain multiple cabling systems  and test  equipment .   • Space to accommodate hardware associated with multiple cabling systems.  For example, a Category 6A cabling system installed to support a wireless  system must be terminated on Category 6A patch panels",What is the recommended cable for drops from the TR (or headend) to the wall outlet in CATV systems?,"['RG -11 coaxial trunk cable.', 'RG -6 coaxial cables.', '625 series cable.', 'Category 6A twisted- pair cable.']",1,Telecom_Infrastructure_Planning.pdf
