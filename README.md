## H2O.ai LLM eval Datasets 

H2O Evals is a collection of Large Language Model datasets for a range of different industries and types of evaluation. The evaluation datasets were generated based on a set of documents within each of the different domains. The datasets have been prepared in a way so they can be used to evaluation both LLM and RAG systems. For each evaluation set, metadata is also attached to let you know the documents used. The format of these datasets allow automatic ingestion to H2O Eval Studio to run your own evaluation. 

These datasets were generated using LLM DataStudio which can also be utilized to help you develop your own evaluation datasets.
