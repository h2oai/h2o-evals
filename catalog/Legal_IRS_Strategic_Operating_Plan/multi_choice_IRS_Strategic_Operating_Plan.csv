Werfel, Commissioner of Internal Revenue  SUBJECT: IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan  I am pleased to transmit the IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan.  In my short time as IRS Commissioner, I am already impressed with the dedication of the IRS workforce  and the progress the agency has been making in delivering for the American people. I hope that through  some of our recent efforts, such as an improved filing season this year and delivery of Economic Impact Payments during the pandemic, taxpayers see how our workforce makes a difference for the nation. We  can do even more to deliver for taxpayers when sufficient resources are provided to the IRS.  The Plan is structured to achieve five objectives, which will be accomplished through a series of initiatives  and projects aligned to each.  1.  Dramatically improve services to help taxpayers meet their obligations and receive the tax incentives  for which they are eligible  2.  Quickly resolve taxpayer issues when they arise  3.  Focus expanded enforcement on taxpayers with complex tax filings and high-dollar noncompliance to  address the tax gap  4.  Deliver cutting-edge technology, data, and analytics to operate more effectively  5.  Attract, retain, and empower a highly skilled, diverse workforce and develop a culture that is better  equipped to deliver results for taxpayers  Taken as a whole, the contents of the Plan provide a vision for the future of Federal tax administration,  which can be summarized as follows:  •  A world class customer service operation where taxpayers can engage with the IRS in a fully digital  manner if they choose, where helpful tools for taxpayers to navigate the complexity of our tax laws are  deployed and then refreshed and updated regularly based on taxpayer feedback, and where our  customer service workforce is maintained at the right size and with the right resources and training to  always be ready to meet the taxpayer demand for assistance.  •  New ca pacities,  including  specialized  skills,  in  place  to  unpack the  complex filings of  high  income  taxpayers and  large  corporations and  partnerships so  Americans have  confidence  that  all t axpayers,  regardless of  means,  are  doing  their  part  to  meet  their  responsibilities under  our  tax laws.  •  An organization and infrastructure rooted in modern technology that provides taxpayers increased confidence that data is secure and that we are prepared to more rapidly meet new requirements or  responsibilities that may emerge in the future.  We will hold ourselves to achieving the Plan vision by regularly monitoring and reporting to Congress on  our progress. We will also update the Plan details as we learn more about what works and as the  2  IRS IRA Strategic Operating Plan                                                        operating environment changes. More important than an y detail in thi s Plan, however, i s our  responsibilit y to improve the customer experience we provide to the American people. The IRS looks  forward to demonstrating how the action s under this Plan will translate into real improvement s in how  taxpayers engage with u s and in the assistance we provide. The Plan articulate s how, through both  service and technolog y enhancements, the experience of the future will loo k and feel much different from  the IRS of today.  Ensuring taxpayer s file accurate return s and pay the taxes they owe is another important component of  this Plan. For the first time, we will help taxpayer s identify potential mistake s before filing and quickl y fix  errors that delay their refunds",What is the importance of the IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan?,"['To provide a vision for the future of Federal tax administration', 'To deliver cutting-edge technology, data, and analytics to operate more effectively', 'To attract, retain, and empower a highly skilled, diverse workforce', 'To address the tax gap']",0,IRS_Strategic_Operating_Plan.pdf

All effort s will comply with  your directive not to use IRA resource s to raise audit rate s on small businesse s and household s making  under $400,000 per year, relative to histori c levels. Our effort s outlined in the Plan to provide better  service to taxpayers, help them file accuratel y and resolve issue s at filing, coupled with technology and  data advances, will allow u s to focus enforcement on taxpayers trying to avoid taxes, rather than  taxpayers trying to pa y what they owe.  I can’t overstate the importance of sustained annual resource s for IRS operating costs. To help put this  issue in perspective, IRS funding ha s steadily declined over the last decade causing suboptimal staffing  and investment. In 2010, for example, we operated with 95,370 FTE to meet the demand s of the U.S.  population (310 million). Today, the IRS i s almost 20 percent smaller (80,006 FTE a s of the end of FY  2022), wherea s the U.S. population ha s increased b y over 7 percent (334 million) and the ta x law has  grown more complex. To cover stead y state operations, annual discretionar y appropriation s must be fully  maintained at the FY 2022 level, including growth for inflation and pa y raises. Any reduction in annual  discretionar y funds – including not providing for inflationar y increases to maintain current level s – will  require IRA funding to be shifted to general operations. Thi s would be to the detriment of the service,  technology, and compliance initiative s envisioned to transform the IRS. Diverting IRA funding to cover  base discretionar y enforcement need s would lead to more noncompliance, leading to decreased revenue  collection and increased deficits. In rebuilding and sustaining our capacit y and capabilitie s with  discretionar y and mandator y funding, we plan to focu s on hiring and growing talent with the right skill s to  address the nation' s increasingl y complex tax system. By leveraging technology, automation, and other  tools, we will enable higher staff efficiency than was historically achieved.  As we publish thi s Plan and wor k with stakeholder s to obtain their feedback, we are also preparing to  transmit supplemental budget material s in the wee ks to come to the relevant Congressional committees  outlining our preliminar y spending plan s by appropriation. These preliminar y plans are in addition to the  estimated spending outlined in the plan through FY 2024. We understand the expectation and  responsibilit y for transparen cy in spending and will provide more detail s as they are available. We intend  to work with these Committee s as we have more detail s on our spending plan s and will include updated  estimated spending in future update s of the Plan and budget submissions. Specifically, we intend to  share staffing information a s we move forward and more detailed technolog y spending in advance of  major technolog y investments.  I look forward to continued engagement with our employees and external stakeholders as we implement  this Plan.

The IRA provides us with approximately $80 billion over the next decade to significantly improve the way we serve the public. We will transform service to taxpayers by using this long-term funding to update technology capabilities and invest  in our employees with new tools, skills, and capabilities. These resources will also ensure the fairness of the tax system by addressing the tax gap—the difference between taxes due and taxes paid—most recently estimated at $496 billion.  The IRS has been significantly underfunded for the past decade, with a budget reduction of 22%  in real terms from 2010 to 2021, leaving us with outdated technology and a shrinking workforce  in the face of an increasingly complex tax environment in which to administer the U.S. tax code.  This lack of investment has led to low levels of service, paper-based processes, antiquated technology, and an overall experience for taxpayers that falls short of what we want to deliver. The IRA investment is already transforming our ability to improve service to taxpayers.  Shortly after enactment, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS initiated an effort to develop  a Strategic Operating Plan, identifying the highest-priority opportunities to deliver transformational  change for taxpayers. The planning process leveraged prior IRS planning efforts, including the  Taxpayer First Act Report to Congress, new thinking around best practices and available technology capabilities, and current and past input from a wide range of stakeholders in tax administration. Additional context that shaped the development of this Plan is available in Part III  and Part V.

"We will improve the taxpayer experience through  better customer service, clearer guidance on how  to correctly file taxes, increased options for filing electronically, and robust online accounts to take  care of business quickly and independently. We  will utilize tailored solutions to meet the diverse  needs and preferences of all taxpayer groups.  Congress has given us responsibility to administer,  as effectively and efficiently as possible, more than  150 credits, deductions and other tax preferences  in the tax law (generally referred to as “incentives”  throughout this Plan). We know that many factors  drive unintentional noncompliance and prevent taxpayers from claiming the incentives for which  they are eligible. We will significantly improve the  services we provide and tailor our compliance work  in new ways. Taxpayers will have the tools,  information and assistance needed to get their tax filings right – both in paying what they owe and  claiming the incentives for which they are eligible. Our employees will likewise have the data,  analytics, and tools to ensure compliance and  fairness in the tax system.  Our work to improve service must also be coupled  with efforts to improve compliance by those who  choose not to meet their obligations. The IRA  acknowledges that an adequately funded federal  tax administration will generate significant revenue for the country. The federal government loses  nearly half a trillion dollars each year due to  taxpayer noncompliance. This investment will  significantly improve the IRS’s ability to address  the tax gap.  We will devote resources to enforcing the tax laws  against taxpayers who attempt to avoid paying  their tax obligations. All compliance efforts will be  consistent with the Secretary of the Treasury’s  August 10, 2022, directive that IRA resources are not used to increase the share of small businesses  or households earning $400,000 or less that are  audited relative to historical levels. We will use the additional resources provided under the IRA to address high-dollar compliance issues, such as those related to complex partnership structures,  large corporations, and high-income individuals.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that  the additional $80 billion provided to the IRS by  the IRA will increase federal revenue by more than $180 billion in the decade ahead, considering only  direct enforcement revenue based on additional  staffing. 1 We believe the actual increase will be  greater, since all our efforts as outlined in this plan—including in the areas of service, issue resolution and effective enforcement—will increase  overall tax compliance. We will also use data and  technology to ensure our resources are focused on  noncompliant taxpayers. Through both service and  enforcement efforts, ensuring taxpayers get their taxes right will help address the tax gap over time.  For a more detailed allocation of funds of the Plan,  please see Part III.  To enable improved taxpayer services and  compliance, we must deliver technology capabilities at a faster pace and bigger scale than  we have achieved before. We will invest in new  technology, building on contemporary foundational  platforms, with modern architectures designed to  meet our future needs. This will require careful coordination between delivering new capabilities  and modernizing or retiring legacy platforms. It will  also require shifting to an IT delivery model that  better integrates business unit perspectives to  deliver faster and better results to improve services to taxpayers. While ensuring the continued privacy  and security of taxpayer data, we will enhance our  use of data and analytics to drive operations and  decision-making. Improved data analytics will  better position us to optimize operations for  taxpayers and employees alike.  We will work to attract and retain the best talent as  we transition to being a modern, digitally capable,  customer-centric agency. We will develop and  support a workforce that has modern tools to do its job effectively, broad knowledge of complex tax  issues, analytical capabilities to work efficiently  and effectively, and the organizational culture  8                                                                                                               PartIPartII Obj 1 Obj 2 Obj 3 Obj 4 Obj 5  PartIII  PartIV PartV  to deliver together",How will the IRS ensure the privacy and security of taxpayer data?,"['By enhancing the use of data and analytics to drive operations and decision-making.', 'By investing in new technology, building on contemporary foundational platforms, with modern architectures designed to meet future needs.', 'By shifting to an IT delivery model that better integrates business unit perspectives to deliver faster and better results to improve services to taxpayers.', 'By modernizing or retiring legacy platforms.']",3,IRS_Strategic_Operating_Plan.pdf
"ØWe will offer notifications and proactive help for taxpayers and tax professionals to find and correct mistakes earlier .

ØWe will retire outdated legacy IT systems  and invest in new technology to improve  customer experience, to provide data-driven  enforcement, and to carry out skill- building on  technology and data across the IRS workforce, so employees are able to use real- time data  and analytics to drive their work and improve productivity. ØWe will devote a larger share of employees to taxpayer -facing roles as demand for  manually processed paper returns and correspondence decreases and systems are automated.  ØWe will recruit, train, and retain a workforce with the skills and capabilities we need—people who put customer service first and are able to use our new technologies to work effectively.

ØWe  will  ensure  the  privacy  and  security  of  taxpayer  data  in  all t hat  we  do.  In ad dition to the transformation funding for the  IRS, the IRA also includes technical tax provisions designed to incentivize energy security and clean energy investment in the United States. We are  actively working to implement these provisions.  While most of this Plan focuses on our overall transformation, we will also describe how these broader efforts will equip us to better deliver the energy security and clean energy provisions that  Congress provided in the IRA.  IRA Transformation Outcomes .  As we move toward the future state described  above, powered by the IRA investment and the  initiatives outlined in this plan, we will measure the overall progress of the transformation according to the following transformation outcomes. In addition  to these outcomes, we will monitor progress in  several other indicators of success defined in Part II of this Plan. We will define detailed performance metrics for initiatives during implementation.  •  World -class service experience: Improved  customer satisfaction metrics  •  Digital -first organization: Digital options for  all taxpayer interactions with the IRS, alongside  the continued option for taxpayers to interact in their preferred mode, such as phone or in  person  IRS IRA Strategic Operating Plan 11  Part I: Executive Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   •  Improved take -up of tax incentives by eligible taxpayers: Increased eligible participation rate of credits and deductions, as well as decrease in inadvertent errorsand improper payments •  Effective enforcement: Reduce the gap between taxes owed and paid •  Employer of choice within governmentand industry: Improved Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey results Accountability to stakeholders and previous IRS strategies  The  IRS  will m ake  this vision  a  reality and  deliver   on  the  commitments in  this Plan  by collaborating   across the  organization  and  engaging  in   disciplined  and  transparent  accountability  processes.  This Plan  outlines the  framework that   we  will u se  to  achieve  the  objectives in  this Plan.

"Low levels of service and limited  customer service options are especially  challenging for low-income taxpayers, those with limited mobility or limited English proficiency, and  those who do not have flexible schedules. In short,  many of those who need help most do not get it,  contributing to tax compliance issues and loss of  trust in the tax system.  We have dramatically increased the number of IRS  employees providing customer service this filing  season, but over the next few years we want to  also dramatically improve technology-driven  options for taxpayers. We will use enhanced data and analytics to forecast customer service demand  and improve customer service access and options,  staffing accordingly. We will enable taxpayers to  schedule service through digital and in-person  channels and develop a plan to provide estimated wait times and on-demand service through all  channels, including at Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs). We will also ensure that  communication channels for tax professionals,  such as the Practitioner Line, are available and accessible.  We will equip the employees who interact with  taxpayers with training and the authority they need  to resolve issues at the lowest appropriate level.

Key projects  1. Create digital forms. Modernize forms so they  are easier to use, mobile-friendly, and take  advantage of digital capabilities and interactive features that paper forms lack.  2. Expand digitalization. Digitalize paper- submitted forms, returns, applications, certifications, correspondence, or remittances  at the point of receipt. This includes scanning  and extracting data from forms, images,  barcodes, and other sources.  3. Enable digital data delivery throughout the  IRS. Clean and deliver data and images to the  appropriate workflows for processing.  4. Reinforce secure storage and archiving  practices. Implement necessary data storage  requirements and best practices to retain proof  of receipt and of senders’ identities. Archive  materials as appropriate and required.  5.
