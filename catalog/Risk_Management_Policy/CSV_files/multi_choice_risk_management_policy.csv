Risks, by their very nature, may or may not occur and fall into a va riety of categories,  the most common are  used in this Policy , namely :  a) Strategic Risks:  the inability to achieve the University’s strategic and operational objectives as set out in the Strategic Plan and also, not availing of opportunities when they arise .  b) Operational Risks : the inability to prevent a loss resulting from inadequate internal  processes and systems.   c) Financial Risks: exposure to losses arising as a result of inadequate controls or the need to improve the management of the University’s financial assets .  d) Reputational Risks :  exposure to losses arising as a result of bad press, negative public  image and the need to improve stakeholder relationship management .   Each of the categories  of risks can exist at different levels:   • Corporate or Strategic Level (Fundamental) ;  • Faculty/Division level (Local);   • Project level.     1.4.3.  Risk Identification   The process of determining what can happen, why and how.     1.4.4.  Risk Analysis    The systematic use of available information to determine the likelihood of specific events occurring and the magnitude of their consequences/impact on the University.     1.4.5.  Risk Assessment    Risks are assessed and prioritised on the combined basis of their likelihood of occurrence and the resulting impact should they materialise.     1.4.6.  Risk Regis ter  A risk register is a risk recording and monitoring tool for the management of identified risks of the University.  It is a hierarchical entity and the University’s Fundamental Risk Register   (FRR) (corporate or strategic level risks) , in addition to the identification and assessment of  risk at a corporate level,  will be informed also by the risks identified and assessed in local  risk registers  (LRR) (Faculty/Division and project level risks) put in place by Faculties and  Administrative Units.     1.4.7.  Risk Ow ner   A Risk O wner (RO) is a person that has been given the authority to manage a particular risk  and is accountable  to their line manager for doing so.     1.4.8.  Primary Register Owner   A Primary Register  Owner (PRO) is the Division Director/Dean who has overall responsibility  for the implementation and embedding of the risk management framework  and the  ongoing development and monitoring of their LRR.   The PRO is required to report to the  Operations Sub Committee, Executive Committee and the Governing Authority A udit & Risk  Committee as required.  5      1.4.9.

Additionally, t he RMO is charged with m onitor ing and  reviewing  all Risk Registers to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Risk  Management Framework  within the parameters set down by the University’s Risk Appetite  statement.  The RMO develops reports on the implementation of the Framework and this  Policy for the consideration of E xecutive Committee , Governing Authority Audit & Risk  Committee and/or Gov erning Authority .    1.4.10.  Risk Appetite   Risk appetite is the amount of risk an organisation is prepared to accept based on the  expected return of the development/activity in question.  The University can be risk -taking  or risk -adverse and different levels of ris k appetite can apply to different activities.  In  deciding its risk appetite, the University will decide the threshold beyond which risks move from being monitored  at a local level to being serious  and monitored at an Executive level,  or finally to the aba ndonment of the particular activity.  Clarity in relation to the  University’s risk appetite is critical to enable Executive Committee decide on the how best to manage any particular risk.  The UL R isk Appetite Statement is reviewed annually .      6     Context      Legal and Regulatory Context     The focus on governance in corporate and public bodies continues to increase. In developing this Risk Management Policy, account has been taken of the  following statutory  and regulatory instruments:    • The 1997 Universities Act   • Code of Governance for Irish Universities  2019   • ISO 3100  (201 8) Risk Management Principles and Guidelines .     Policy Statements       Principles for Risk Management    The University adopts the principles of risk management as set out in the ISO  3100 (2018)  Standard and actively works towards complying with these principles to ensure that risk management is effective.    Principles of Risk  Management:  Compliance with the principles will deliver or ensure  that:   Create and protect value The University can demonstrably pursue its strategic  objectives in research, learning and teaching, commercial undertakings and community engagement.   Are an integral part of all  organisational processes  Risk management principles and practices are embedded into governance,  enterprise and operational strategy,  planning and management, policies, values and culture.   Is part of decision making  Each individual recognises the mandate for risk  management that is led by Governing Authority, the President , the Executive Committee, and other  senior  management  so that all decision -makers make informed  choices, prioritise actions and recognise  and record  options and alternative courses of action and their  consequences .  Explicitly  address  uncertainty  In taking account of uncertainty, decision -makers have  regard for context and use knowledge, evidence and  judgment to treat or mitigate risk .  Are systematic, structured  and timely  The University’s approach to risk pursues both  effectiveness and efficiency to achieve consistent,  comparable  and reliable results.   Are based on the best  available information  In using their judgment and discernment, decision -makers  will consider available information, experience, forecasts and stakeholder feedback  as appropriate . 7   Are customized for the  internal and external  context  Decision -makers consider the statutory and operational  mandates, requirements and expectations of internal and  external regulators, auditors, funders, governing  authorities and agencies; and account for the University’s  strate gic plans, risk profile and undertakings .

Vice Presidents/Deans/Heads of Administrative Units   Vice Presidents/Deans/Heads of Administrative Units are responsible for the following in relation to risk management:   • Implementation of University Policy in relation to Risk Management within their area of control ;  • Identification, assessment, management and ownership of risk within thei r area of  control ;  • Establishment and regular review of the LRR  in their area and, where the Head of the  Administrative Unit is not a member of the Executive Committee, its transmission   annually  to their line manager who is a member or as required through e scalation  provisions set out in the Guide to Risk Management  in  Appendix 1 ;  • Vice Presidents/Deans/Heads of Administrative Units will report annually to the  Operations Sub -Committee on the LRRs  within their areas of control;   • The identification of new and emerging risks that cannot be managed locally and the  reporting of such risks to the  Operations Sub -Committee or if required, directly to   Executive Committee for escalation to the Fundamental Risk Register ;  • Ensuring that all substantial projects or new programmes undergo risk assessment and that such assessment is included in the project/ programme proposal, and  reporting on same to the Executive Committee ;  • Supporting the embedding of risk management in their area and the development of a risk -aware culture.     4.4.6.  Role of  Staff  All staff play  a critical role in ensuring the effectiveness of risk management within their 12   areas of responsibility through:   • Effectively manage risk within their areas of responsibility in acc ordance with the  University’s Risk Management Policy and Guidelines;   • Report risks beyond their scope of authority or resources to their line manager.     4.4.7.  Risk Management Function   The Corporate Secretary of the University has overall responsibility for ensuring that   procedures  and processes are in place to enable adherence to this Risk Management Policy.   Additionally, the Corporate Secretary , through the University’s RMO, will:   • Ensure the provision of adequate training and awareness to Risk Register Owners   • Ensure the communication of the key elements of the University’s Risk Management  Framework  to those responsible for its implementation ;  • Maintain the University’s Fundamental Risk Register, including  its review and update  on an annual basis ;  • Undertake a review of LRRs  to ensure compliance with this Policy and the UL Risk  Apetite Statement.     4.4.8.  Internal Audit   Taking a risk based approach, Internal Audit is responsible for the review of internal controls within the University.  In developing its Annual Internal Audit Plan Internal Audit  will take cognisance of the University’s Fundamental Risk Register and local risk registers.  Internal Audit  reviews of University functions/units will include an assessment of the  effectiveness of their respective risk management processes a nd will provide independent  assurance to the Governing Authority, through its Audit & Risk Committee, that risks are being managed appropriately.      Procedure for Treatment of Risk:    Upon completion of a risk assessment and taking account of the University’ s risk appetite,  the University may decide to:   • Treat the risk (e.g. use of internal controls);   • Terminate the risk ;  • Tolerate the risk ( accept the risk with or without monitoring),  or  • Transfer the risk (e.g. by using insurance, sub- contracti ng).     Risk Assessment required when undertaking Major Development/Activity    A major development/activity may be defined as having an annual  value in excess of  €500,000 which may pose a significant risk to the University.  Any such proposed development/activity a nd associated risks when identified must be reported to the  Executive Committee for consideration immediately they arise.       Procedure for alignment of risk with the Risk Appetite  Statement    The University’s risk appetite defines how it accepts and manages  risk",What is the requirement for reporting major developments/activities that may pose a significant risk to the University?,"['The development/activity must be reported to the Executive Committee for consideration immediately they arise.', 'The development/activity must be reported to the Operations Sub-Committee for review and approval.', 'The development/activity must be reported to the Risk Management Function for assessment and approval.', 'The development/activity must be reported to the Internal Audit for review and approval.']",0,Risk Management Policy.pdf
41,"Any such proposed development/activity a nd associated risks when identified must be reported to the  Executive Committee for consideration immediately they arise.       Procedure for alignment of risk with the Risk Appetite  Statement    The University’s risk appetite defines how it accepts and manages  risk. Risk elements arising  from proposed or actual developments/activities within the University may fall into three categories:   I. Risks that are trivial and therefore acceptable and do not need to be managed;  13   II. Risks that are acceptable and routinely arise in certain types of activity that will need  to be managed;   III. Risks that are unacceptable and therefore the development/activity should not proceed ;  IV. The concept of risk appetite applies to major developments/activities and is concerned with the placing of a b oundary between (ii) and (iii) above.  It therefore  reflects the University’s tolerance of risk.     The University’s risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually together with the  Fundamental Risk Register and submitted to the Governing Authority post en dorsement  from the ARC in line with the provisions of Code of Governance for Irish Universities (2019).

Having identified the inherent risk and the impact and likelihood of that risk, it is necessary to consider the controls whic h would mitigate  the impact  and likelihood of that risk being realised.      A control has three characteristics:   1 An action - what is the control trying to achieve,   2 An owner -  who excercises the control and   3 A timeline -  how often is the control excercised?     It is essential to distinguish between those controls that are in place (current controls) and those that are planned (future  controls).       Current Controls     A current control is any measure or action that  is in place and mitigates  risk. Controls include t he implementation of any  policy, procedure, practice,  process or technology that modifies or manages risk .    It is important to note that the assessment of residual risk can only be based on current controls being implemented.    19     Future Control s    A future control is any measure or action that has been identified to be implemented to mitigate the risk and reduce the resi dual risk score. Future  control s and act ion items are always required for each identified risk  with a residual risk rating of 3 or more .     A future control  moves to a current control when it has been implemented fully.       It should be noted that a  current control can also be deemed  a future/ongoing  control where a future action is required to ensure continual monitoring  and mitigation of the risk identified.       If the risk identified has a Residual Risk rating of 3 or less it should remain as an identified risk at this residual risk r ating for two review periods. At  the end of the second review if the Register Owner is  satisfied that the residual risk is being managed and maintained at the minor score level then  the risk may be removed from the Register.         20   2.4 Risk & Control Template    2.4",What are the three characteristics of a control?,"['Action, owner, and timeline.', 'Risk, impact, and likelihood.', 'Policy, procedure, practice, process, or technology.', 'Implementation, assessment, and mitigation.']",0,Risk Management Policy.pdf
