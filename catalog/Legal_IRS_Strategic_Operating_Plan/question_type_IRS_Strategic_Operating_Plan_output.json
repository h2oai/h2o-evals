The IRS will also hold itself accountable by regularly monitoring and reporting to Congress on its progress and updating the plan details as it learns more about what works and as the operating environment changes."

                        "To achieve these goals, Initiative 1.2 will first expand digital services and digitalization, enabling taxpayers to file all documents securely and exchange correspondence electronically. This will be done by providing taxpayers the option to file documents electronically and securely, processing all forms, returns, and certifications digitally regardless of how they are submitted, while maintaining paper submission options. Additionally, Initiative 1.2 will ensure that taxpayers claiming credits are able to securely file digitally and are not unduly burdened during filing. To support this, Initiative 1.2 will scan and digitalize all incoming paper forms, returns, and communications to process them digitally. Furthermore, Initiative 1.2 will modernize forms and other documents to make them mobile-friendly, shifting away from the structure of traditional paper forms toward easy-to-use, interactive forms that can be easily updated and improved in response to changes in customer needs and tax laws. This will be achieved by redesigning service delivery, business processes, enterprise scanning, data intake, legacy systems, and case management systems to fully enable digital processing."
