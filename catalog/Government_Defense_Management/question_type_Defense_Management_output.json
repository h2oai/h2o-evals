In the context of defense policy and management, governance can impact the implementation of defense policy by introducing new models of public services distinct from traditional public administration, promoting transparency and accountability in executive management, and establishing economic and social conditions for loans from international agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The book highlights the need for efficient and effective management in the defense sector, particularly in the context of democratic control and the challenges faced by the defense sector in the Euro-Atlantic community. It also explores the importance of managerial practices in addressing issues such as allocating financial and human resources, solving strategic and operational problems, and maximizing the operational performance of armed forces. By providing a framework for defense management that is anchored in democratic control and emphasizes the need for excellence at all levels and in every department of the defense establishment, the book offers a valuable resource for governments and defense organizations seeking to modernize their defense sectors while ensuring democratic control and efficient management."

Public governance, in particular, emerges from privatizing traditional public administrative and service functions and aims to introduce a new model of public services distinct from public administration. The state's role in ensuring national security and promoting national interests remains crucial, and public governance fits into this framework by providing an alternative model of control and regulation that complements the state's role. The state's capabilities to defend the national territory and promote national interests using military power and diplomacy remain essential, but public governance offers a means to address issues that may not be solved by the state alone, such as global warming, international trade, and arms control. Thus, public governance can enhance the state's ability to ensure national security and promote national interests by providing a new model of governance that complements the state's role and addresses emerging global challenges."

This includes the capability to defend the territory and national interests using military power and to promote national interests abroad. However, the concept of 'good governance' goes beyond the state's role in defense and national interests, it is based on the understanding that effective economic management and a stable social environment can only be achieved through the full application of democratic and market principles. This means that good governance involves not only the state's ability to provide security but also the presence of transparency, accountability, and participation in decision-making processes, which are essential for ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account."

This shift has implications for the implementation of social governance initiatives, which aim to address social issues through collective bargaining and cooperation among diverse stakeholders. The success of social governance initiatives depends on the ability of actors to work together and build trust, which can be challenging in the context of complex and diverse societies. Moreover, the role of the state in facilitating social governance initiatives is critical, as it can provide the necessary framework and resources for successful collaboration and coordination among stakeholders."
