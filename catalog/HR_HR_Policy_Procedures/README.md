#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the purpose of the Human Resources Policy and Procedures Handbook?

**Answer:** The purpose of the handbook is to provide a fair, safe, and enjoyable working environment for employees, volunteers, and contractors. It also aims to provide guidelines for building a healthy environment, explain the foundation's final decisions, and serve as a standard reference for the board of directors, employees, and contractors regarding their rights and responsibilities.

**Token Presence:** nan

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What should be done when a Conflict of Interest on the part of an employee, volunteer, or contractor of the Foundation is disclosed?

**Answer:** The individual should declare the Conflict of Interest and absent themselves from the discussion. The minutes of all actions taken related to the matter should clearly reflect that these requirements have been met.
