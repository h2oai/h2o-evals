The ability to adjust prices and affect business costs quickly in response to external labor market conditions is illustrated by the series of foreign worker levy rebates that were rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.

By managing the qualifying salary, the government can ensure that foreign professionals, managers, and executives are attracted to work in Singapore while also protecting the resident labor force.

The 'Foreign Talent' strategy targeted high-skilled workers for long-term assimilation and was designed to fill positions that required skills that were relatively rare in the resident population, while the 'Foreign Worker' strategy managed low-skilled workers for economic necessity but carefully managed their social and economic trade-offs. The S Pass system was introduced for medium-skilled foreign workers who fell short of the high-skilled threshold, and it was managed through a levy and quota system similar to that used for low-skilled workers, but S Pass holders were not subject to societal management policies such as restrictions on source countries and were seen as a potential source for long-term assimilation.

On the one hand, it helps to ensure that foreign professionals, managers, and executives who are granted EPs are of high quality and comparable to the upper one-third of resident workers in the same skill category, which is in line with the policy objective of maintaining a high-quality workforce. Additionally, it protects the resident labor force by ensuring that employers must demonstrate that they have fairly considered residents for the role before they are eligible to apply for an EP. On the other hand, it limits the flexibility of EP holders, who are not allowed to change employers freely and are required to work and live at the employer's home. This could potentially limit the ability of EP holders to seek better job opportunities or negotiate better salaries and benefits. Furthermore, the policy may also impact the ability of Singapore to attract and retain top talent, as high-skilled professionals may be deterred by the lack of job mobility. However, the policy also ensures that there is no quota on the number of EPs that can be granted, and no limit on the countries that the EP holder can come from, which allows for a diverse and skilled workforce in Singapore."

This led to a dramatic increase in the number of women of child-bearing age and a decrease in the overall sex ratio, contributing to natural increase becoming the major source of population growth in the post-war period. The high fertility rates during the post-war baby boom also contributed to natural increase, and by the first post-independence Census in 1970, natural increase accounted for 94.8 percent of intercensal population growth from 1957 to 1971."

                    "expected_output": "According to Figure 2, the foreign-born population in Singapore gradually declined and plateaued from 1960 to the 1990s, before rapidly and continuously rising in the 1990s. Unfortunately, there are few official statistics on the breakdown of the foreign-born population within the resident category. However, a substantial portion of resident labor force growth during the late 1990s onward can be attributed to the assimilation of migrants. As shown in Figure 1, the non-resident labor force grew from 248,200 workers in 1990 to more than one million workers in 2008, comprising more than one-third (34.41%) of the total workforce. The growth of the resident workforce was relatively more stable, at approximately 38,000 workers per year. Therefore, the foreign-born population in Singapore in 2008 was likely a significant portion of the total workforce, and played a notable role in the growth of the resident workforce during the late 1990s and early 2000s."
