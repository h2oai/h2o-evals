The state's role in ensuring national security and promoting national interests remains crucial, and public governance fits into this framework by providing an alternative model of control and regulation that complements the state's role. The state's capabilities to defend the national territory and promote national interests using military power and diplomacy remain essential, but public governance offers a means to address issues that may not be solved by the state alone, such as global warming, international trade, and arms control. Thus, public governance can enhance the state's ability to ensure national security and promote national interests by providing a new model of governance that complements the state's role and addresses emerging global challenges."
