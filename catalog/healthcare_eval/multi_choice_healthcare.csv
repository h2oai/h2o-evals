0,"Healthcare System in Singapore   ACTU4625 TOPICS: HEALTH INSURANCE   Yu BAI, Chaoran SHI , Xiaoteng LI, & Feifei LIU            1   Background   Singapore, an island country with population of 5.2 million, is well -known for its efficient  and widely covered healthcare system. The early primary health care,  after Singapore’s   independence in 1965,  started with a mass -inoculation program against severe  tropical  epidemic diseases . In order to provide convenience to the out -patient attendances,  the  government  extended the network of hospitalization, including general hospitals, satellite  out-patient dispensaries and maternal and child health clinics. Healthcare  ranked as  the fifth  priority for public funds .    To foresee and avoid the future problems, Government promoted a National Health Plan in  1983. It detailed the infrastructural plan for the next 20 years  together with  the idea of  Medisave. In 1985,  the “restructuring” of public sector hospitals started to merge the business  and financial disciplines into health care services for the purpose of providing higher quality  of ser vices and financing efficiently  (Lim, 1998) . The e xpenditure of national health care  was  maintained at the level of 3% of GDP through the period of 1980s to 1990s. The dollar term  steadily increased every year from 1967 to 1995. In 2002, the government promulgated  the  ElderShield plan so as to help th e elders and the severe disabled  in particular .    Healthcare System  Regulators   The philosophy of Singapore’s healthcare system consists of three pillars. Firstly, the country  is aimed to build up a healthy population with preventive health cares and to encourage  healthy lifestyles. Secondly, Singapore also emphasizes personal respons ibility t owards  healthy living through the  “3M” (Medisave, Medishield and Medifund) system. Lastly, the  government has to keep  the healthcare costs down by controlling the supply side of the  healthcare services and providing heavy subsidies at public healt hcare institutions.     There are three main regulators in the system, Minister of Health (MOH), Central Provident  Fund (CPF) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). MOH oversees the provision and  regulation of healthcare services . Specifically, it is in c harge of promoting health education,  monitoring the accessibility and quality of healthcare services, preventi ng and controlling  diseases, allocating resources and specialists  and administrating required licenses for  healthcare establishments .     CPF is a comprehensive and compulsory social security savings plan. It ensures working  Singaporeans and permanent residents  (PRs)  to support themselves in the old age. CPF has  expended its objectives  to meet the population’s needs in retirement, housing, family  protection, asset enhancement and healthcare . Workers and employers  are required to  make  monthly contributions to the employees’ CPF into three accounts, ordinary account, special  account and the Medisave account.      MAS, as Singapore’s central bank, regulates  the financial aspect of insurance sector . The 2   Insurance Department of MAS  administer s the insurance Act , which protects the interests of  policyholders and regula tes insurers’  activities, including registration and licensing  requirements. Periodically, MAS provides  directions and practice notes for regulating  insurance activities.      Healthcare Delivery System   Singapore ’s healthcare delivery system provides population the primary healthcare, hospital  care, long -term care and other integrated care.     Singap ore has an island network of outpatient polyclinics and private medical practitioner's  clinic s to provide primary medical treatments, preventive healthcare as well as health  education. Eighty percent of primary healthcare services are offered by 2000 private medical  clinics; whereas the remaining is delivered by 18 government polyclinics.      Hospital care consists of inpatient, outpatient and emergency services. By contrast to primary  healthcare, public hospitals provide 80% of hospital care. The public  hospitals are  structured   by regions  with five clusters : Alexandra Health Pte Ltd (AHPL), Jurong Health Services  (JHS), National University Health System (NUHS) National Healthcare Group (NHG) and  Singapor e Health Services (SHS).

(Department of  Statistics Singapore,  2011)     Healthcare Financing   PUBLIC FINANCING   The public financing for Healthcare system consist mainly by “3M”, shorted for Medisave,  MediShield and Medifund, plus ElderShield being promoted most recently.     Medisave  is a national medical insurance scheme through which members build savings for  their healthcare needs. In addition to hospitalization expenses  and certain outpatient  treatments for members and immediate family members, Medisave can be used to pay for  Medi Shield premiums and Private Medical Insurance Scheme (PMIS) as well.     Monthly contribution to the Medisave Account is mandatory for CPF members. The rates are  determined based on retained age, ranging from 7% to 9% of monthly salary, up to at most  S$41000  per year  (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2010) . Members can claim their hospital  charges  including in -patient charges and surgical expenses. Medisave can also be used to 3   cover outpatient treatments, subject to the withdrawal li mit.     As the increase in the total population, the number of Medisave accounts goes up to three  million with a total balance of 50.2 billion. The  annual  amount withdrawn by each member is  around S$732 on average.  (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2012)     MediShield , as a complementary plan to Medisave, is a catastrophic medical insurance that  enables members to settle part of the expenses arising from prolonged hospitalization and  certain outpatient treatments fo r serious illnesses  incurred in medical institutions involved .  Singapore citizens and PRs are eligible to opt in the scheme. The a nnual premiums increase  by ages from S$33  with age below 30,  to S$1,123 with age between 84 and 85 . Medishield  does not provide coverage to people aged 85 years old and above. Rates for members in other  ages are outlined in table 5. The number of Medishield policyholders reached to 3.39 million,  out of which about 2.67 million polic yholders also enrolled in PMIS.  (Ministry of Health  Singapore, 2012)     ElderShield  is an affordable severe disability insurance which provides basic financial  protection to those who need long -term care, especially for elder  population . Prior to  September 31, 2007, E ldershield pa id S$30 0 monthly for maximum 60 months , which was  known  as Eldershield300; thereafter,  the benefit was increased to  S$400 monthly up to 72  months (Eldershield400) to pay the out of pocket expenses.     MOH has appointed three private insurers , Aviva, Great Eastern and NTUC Income,  to run  ElderShield.  Singapore citizens and PRs enrolled in Medisave are automatically covered  under ElderShield at the age of 40. Eldershield requires level premium calculated ba sed on  the entry -age. Premiums are payable  annually until members reach 65 years old.     Medifund  is an endowment fund set up by Singapore government to help  citizens and PRs  whose Medisave and MediShield are inadequate to pay the medical expenses.  The fund will  be added  when the budget surplus available . The  total size of Medifund amounts  was  S$1.3875 billion by 2010.  The amount a patient can claim under Medifund depends on the  financial and social circumstances. The application for Medifund is subject to the approval of   Medifund -approved institutions (MFI).  By the end of 2010, MFI had approved 481 million  applicants for Medifund assistants.
