"1 Regulatory Objectives 1.1.1 Why Regulate Telecommunications? The last decade of the 20th Century saw unprecedented changes in the global telecommuni-cations industry. Numerous state-ownedtelecommunications operators were privatized, and a wave of pro-competitive and deregulatory tele- communications policies swept the world. Newmarket-based approaches to the supply oftelecommunications services were introduced inscores of countries. This liberalization of telecommunications markets was motivated by various factors, including: ➢ Increasing evidence that more liberalized tele- communications markets were growing andinnovating faster and serving customers better ➢ The need to attract private sector capital to expand and upgrade telecommunications networks, and to introduce new services ➢ Growth of the Internet, which caused data traffic to overtake voice traffic in many countries, andled to the introduction of many new serviceproviders ➢ Growth of mobile and other wireless services, which provided alternatives to fixed networksand introduced new service providers to tele- communications markets ➢ Development of international trade in telecom- munications services, which are increasinglyprovided by transnational and global serviceproviders As market-based approaches were adopted during the 1990s, the number of national telecommunica-tions regulatory authorities increased from 12 to over90 around the world. To some this appears ironic.Shouldn’t the market-based supply of telecommuni-cations be accompanied by less regulatory intervention, rather than more? The consensus answer around the world is yes – in the long run, but no in the short run. The successfultransformation of monopolistic telecommunicationsmarkets into competitive ones requires regulatory intervention. Without it, viable competition is not likely to emerge. In fact, the times when privatizationand the introduction of significant competition occurcan be the busiest periods in the life cycle of aregulatory organization. Regulatory intervention is required for a variety of reasons. Typically, regulators must authorize or license new operators. They must often removebarriers to market entry by new operators. Theymust oversee interconnection of new entrants withincumbent operators. Regulatory intervention mayTelecommunications Regulation Handbook                                         1 - 2also be required to ensure competitive markets do not fail to serve high cost areas or low income subscribers. The objectives of telecommunications regulation vary from country to country. Governments in mostcountries continue to see telecommunications as anessential public service. Even after telecommunica- tions networks are no longer run by them, governments normally retain a regulatory role toensure that telecommunications services aresupplied in a manner consistent with nationalperceptions of the public interest. With the widespread adoption of market-based approaches to the supply of telecommunications services, there is a growing consensus that regula-tors should not be involved in detailed“management” of the sector. Instead, the regulators’role is seen to involve maintenance of a regulatory environment conducive to the efficient supply oftelecommunications services to the public. The service suppliers will generally be private sector operators. The trend today is toward deregulation. Some traditional forms of telecommunications regulationare now viewed as having been more damagingthan beneficial to the development of national tele- communications infrastructure and services. Today, when regulatory measures are proposed orreviewed, governments and regulators mustgenerally ensure that (1) there is a demonstratedneed to regulate, and (2) the most efficient measureis selected to meet the specific regulatory objective.

Box 1-1:  Widely Accepted Regulatory Objectives ➢ Promote universal access to basic telecommunications services ➢ Foster competitive markets to promote: ➢ efficient supply of telecommunications services ➢ good quality of service ➢ advanced services, and ➢ efficient prices ➢ Where competitive markets do not exist or fail, prevent abuses of market power such as excessive pricing and anti-competitive behaviour by dominant firms ➢ Create a favourable climate to promote investment to expand telecommunications networks ➢ Promote public confidence in telecommunications markets through transparent regulatory and licensing processes ➢ Protect consumer rights, including privacy rights ➢ Promote increased telecommunications connectivity for all users through efficient interconnection arrangements ➢ Optimize use of scarce resources, such as the radio spectrum, numbers and rights of wayModule 1 – Overview of Telecommunications Regulation                                         1 - 3Overview 1.1.2 Expansion of Telecommunications Regulation Government regulation of private sector telecommu- nications operators began in the US and Canada inthe late 19th Century. However, in most of the world,telecommunications networks were operated bygovernment administrations for most of the 20th Century. In most countries, governments ran tele- communications operations in the same way asgovernment postal, rail or highway transportationservices. This situation changed dramatically overthe past ten years, as dozens of countries privatizedtheir telecommunications operations. The number of telecommunications regulators has increased rapidly over the past few years. Severalfactors precipitated this growth in regulation. Themajor factor is the implementation of telecommuni-cations reforms that led to the separation of the policy, regulatory and operational functions of telecommunications. Regulatory agencies were established at the same time that many government telecommunicationsadministrations were privatized. The overall objective of these new regulators was to ensure that public policy objectives for the sector continued to bemet. While government monopolies are notperceived to require regulation, private monopoliesgenerally are. Introduction of competitors in manynewly privatized markets also increased the need for new regulators, to act as referees between the new entrants and incumbent operators. ITU data indicate that in 1990, 12 countries had telecommunications regulatory agencies thatfunctioned separately from telecommunicationsoperators. The term “separate regulators” generally refers to agencies that operate separately from government ministries or PTTs that are alsoresponsible for the provision of telecommunicationsservices. By August 1999, that number hadincreased to 84. Nine new regulators were estab- lished between mid-1998 and mid-1999. In late 2000, the number was around 96 and increasing.The growth in the establishment of separateregulators is illustrated graphically in Figure 1-1.

In many cases, new regulators replace existing PTT orMinistry functions. Therefore, in some countries, theestablishment of separate regulators may not resultin an increase in the number of government officialswith regulatory functions. Also, while there is likely to be an increase in regulatory activity around the time of privatization and the introduction of competition,the level of regulatory intervention can be expectedto drop significantly once competitive markets areestablished.1.1",What are the two main objectives of telecommunications regulation?,"['Promote universal access to basic telecommunications services and foster competitive markets to promote efficient supply of telecommunications services.', 'Optimize use of scarce resources, such as the radio spectrum, numbers, and rights of way, and protect consumer rights, including privacy rights.', 'Promote increased telecommunications connectivity for all users through efficient interconnection arrangements and create a favourable climate to promote investment to expand telecommunications networks.', 'Prevent abuses of market power such as excessive pricing and anti-competitive behavior by dominant firms and promote public confidence in telecommunications markets through transparent regulatory and licensing processes.']",0,Telecommunication_Regulations.pdf

In many cases, new regulators replace existing PTT orMinistry functions. Therefore, in some countries, theestablishment of separate regulators may not resultin an increase in the number of government officialswith regulatory functions. Also, while there is likely to be an increase in regulatory activity around the time of privatization and the introduction of competition,the level of regulatory intervention can be expectedto drop significantly once competitive markets areestablished.1.1",What is the percentage of separate regulators in the Asia-Pacific region in 1999?,"['24%', '31%', '13%', '26%']",2,Telecommunication_Regulations.pdf

This structure has the following features: ➢ Government officials can set policies in the national interest, without conflicting concerns based on their role as owners, managers or employees of telecommunications operators. Inparticular, governments are more inclined tointroduce significant competition in telecommu-nications markets if they do not also run themain operator. ➢ Separate regulatory authorities can implement government policy in an objective and impartialmanner. Separation from state-owned telecom-munications operators increases the ability ofregulators to act impartially toward all market participants, for example in matters involving competition policy or interconnection. ➢ Market confidence in the impartiality of regula- tory decisions generally increases with thedegree of independence of regulators from bothoperators and governments. Such market confidence promotes increased foreign and domestic investment in both incumbentoperators and new entrants in the sector. ➢ Privately owned operators can make rational economic decisions about the supply of tele-communications services, without conflicting concerns arising from government ownership.

This resulted ininefficiency and added costs for consumers. Inmost cases, privatization of telecommunicationsoperations has increased the supply of tele-communications services and reduced costs. “Commercialization” of state-owned operators can also increase immunity from governmentinterference, relative to traditional PTTs.However, the degree of immunity depends onthe degree of independence granted to the“commercialized” state operators. While there continue to be different views about the best institutional structure for the telecommunica-tions sector in different countries, the modeldescribed above has clearly become the standardone. Other models are often seen as transitional, with recognition that the “standard” model will ultimately be adopted. In some countries, other government ministries or agencies may play key roles in the telecommunica-tions sector. For instance, a competition authoritymay be an important component of the institutional structure (the respective roles of a general competi- tion authority and a sector-specific telecommunica-tions regulator are discussed in detail in Module 5).Other organizations that may play a significant rolein determining the overall economic environment ofthe telecommunications sector include ministries of finance and ministries of planning, as well as privatization and tax authorities. All of theseinstitutions can play particularly important roles atthe time of privatization. However, once privatizationis completed, they often take on a more secondaryrole to the three entities described in the “standard mode”. 1.2.2 The National Regulatory AuthorityAn increasing number of governments have developed an institutional structure of the type illus-trated in Table 1-2, which includes a separate national regulatory authority. A variety of approaches have been developed to establish andoperate such regulatory authorities. In the followingsections we consider five major issues thatfrequently arise:➢ Independence of the Regulator ➢ Funding of the Regulatory Process ➢ Single Regulators and Collegial Commissions ➢ Multi-Sector Regulators ➢ Organization of Regulatory Staff 1.2.2.1 Independence of the RegulatorAs illustrated in Table 1-2, the standard institutional structure for the telecommunications sector around the world today includes a separate regulator. Whatis most important in this regard is separation of theregulator from the telecommunications operator(s) inthe market. Such separation inspires marketconfidence and promotes compliance with interna- tional trade obligations",What is the purpose of the institutional structure in the telecommunications sector?,"['To provide a framework for the government to maintain control over the telecommunications sector.', 'To promote competition and increase foreign and domestic investment in the sector.', 'To ensure that the telecommunications operator(s) in the market are able to make rational economic decisions.', 'To protect the interests of consumers and ensure that they have access to affordable and high-quality telecommunications services.']",1,Telecommunication_Regulations.pdf

Budget appropriations are alsoused for many separate regulators. However, licence fees and spectrum fees paid by operators provide an increasingly common means to fund theregulatory function. A typical approach to levying licence fees is to distribute the costs of running the regulatory functions among all licensed telecommunications operators in proportion to their gross telecommuni-cations revenues. Thus, in the early years, theincumbent operator (e.g. the former PTT) may pay90% of the regulator’s costs because it earns 90% oftelecommunications revenues in the sector.

"2.2.1 Independence of the RegulatorAs illustrated in Table 1-2, the standard institutional structure for the telecommunications sector around the world today includes a separate regulator. Whatis most important in this regard is separation of theregulator from the telecommunications operator(s) inthe market. Such separation inspires marketconfidence and promotes compliance with interna- tional trade obligations. Of equal importance in the eyes of many experienced telecommunications experts isindependence of the regulator from governments. Inpractice the degree of such independence varies considerably from country to country. It depends on the legal, political and institutional structure of eachcountry. Regulators in few, if any, countries enjoycomplete independence from governments. At aminimum, most regulators are appointed and paidby governments, and have budgets established or controlled by them. There are good reasons for increasing the degree of independence of regulators from governments. Suchindependence increases perceived neutrality andinsulation from political or operational pressures.This perception of independence is particularly important where a government retains ownership of the PTO. Telecommunications operators and investors will generally have greater confidence that anindependent organization will regulate a marketobjectively and transparently. This can lead to increased investment in the sector and to related benefits for the economy. Such confidence will,however, depend on the credibility of the regulator. Itmust have a demonstrated capability to regulate in aprofessional and impartial manner.Module 1 – Overview of Telecommunications Regulation                                         1 - 7Overview In some countries, separation of regulators from the general government administration also provides an opportunity to pay higher salaries to regulatoryofficials. This can be important in developing andtransitional economies where extremely low gov-ernment pay scales can make it difficult to attractand retain highly qualified and non-corruptible staff. The best staff of regulators in such countries can easily be lost to the private sector if the regulators’pay scale is not competitive. Finally, it must be clear that “independence” of the regulator does not mean independence from thelaws and policies of a country. The mandate of an independent regulator should be clearly spelled out in national laws. Regulators should be accountableto legislatures or other government bodies. Suchaccountability should include mechanisms, such asannual reports or legislative hearings, in which the regulator must demonstrate in a transparent manner that it has properly exercised its mandate. 1.2.2.2 Funding the Regulatory ProcessIt is essential to provide adequate funding for the regulatory process. Funding is required to hire goodcalibre professional staff and consultants that can implement regulatory objectives. Without adequate funding, regulation will not usually be effective.Regulatory objectives related to the opening ofcompetitive markets and the establishment of a levelplaying field are not likely to be achieved. Separate regulators can be funded in a number of ways. Traditionally, regulatory functions were funded out of general government budget appropriations,particularly when the functions were carried outwithin Ministries of Communications or PTTAdministrations. Budget appropriations are alsoused for many separate regulators. However, licence fees and spectrum fees paid by operators provide an increasingly common means to fund theregulatory function. A typical approach to levying licence fees is to distribute the costs of running the regulatory functions among all licensed telecommunications operators in proportion to their gross telecommuni-cations revenues. Thus, in the early years, theincumbent operator (e.g. the former PTT) may pay90% of the regulator’s costs because it earns 90% oftelecommunications revenues in the sector. Over time, however, the licence fees payable by the incumbent will decrease, as other operators gainmarket share.

This structure was similar to other govern- ment organizational models used in some of thecountries where the new regulators were estab-lished. An early example was Oftel, the UKregulator, which was established in 1984, when British Telecommunications was privatized. As with the commission model, regulators headed by asingle official are usually assisted by varioustechnical, professional and support staff, as well asoutside consultants.Telecommunications Regulation Handbook                                         1 - 8In the latter part of the 1990s, the commission approach became more popular again.

New regulatorsestablished in Albania, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Kenya, Malawi and Malaysia are all collegial bodies. There are advantages and disadvantages to both the hierarchical and collegial approaches. Neithercan be said to be superior in all cases. However,several observations can be made: ➢ Single regulators can act more quickly and decisively than collegial bodies. ➢ Collegial bodies provide checks, balances and collegial support for the decision-makers.Decisions can therefore be more thoroughlydebated and considered. ➢ Large collegial bodies can lead to less cohesion and consistency than small ones or singleregulators. ➢ Some countries with large collegial bodies have reduced them in size to increase decision-making efficiency (e.g. the US). ➢ Some collegial bodies, especially large ones, have part-time members.

Specific types of regulatory decisions require qualified economists,engineers, lawyers, accountants and financialanalysts. However, many other decisions benefitfrom having a range of different professionalskills and perspectives brought to bear. Where high-calibre professional skills are not immediately available within the public service,outside experts should be brought in.

Many effective regulatory organizations employ a “task force” or “working group” approach to staffing teams toadvise on important regulatory decisions. Thesetask forces are often selected from differentbranches of the regulatory organization. Theyare frequently brought together solely for a specific project. ➢ Consideration should be made to contracting out specific regulatory functions, rather thanbuilding large permanent staff organizations.This approach is recommended by the authorsof the regulatory strategies checklist for developing economies (Table 1-4).
