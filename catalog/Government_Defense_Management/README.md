#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the main focus of the book "Defence Management: An Introduction"?

**Answer:** The main focus of the book "Defence Management: An Introduction" is to provide an introduction to the principles and approaches of formulating and implementing security and defence policies, as well as presenting examples of good practice in transforming and managing security sector organisations, processes and resources.

**Token Presence:** ['introduction', 'security', 'defence', 'policies', 'organisations', 'resources']
