"What are the factors that contribute to unsafe abortion, and how do they relate to the leading causes of maternal mortality, and how does the legal status of abortion impact access to safe abortion care, and what are the differences in access to safe abortion care between developed and developing countries, and how does the lack of access to contraception and reproductive health information contribute to the high rates of unsafe abortion in developing countries?","Unsafe abortion is a major public health problem in developing countries, where 250 times more women die due to unsafe abortion compared to developed countries. The leading causes of maternal mortality are hemorrhage, infection, unsafe abortion, and eclampsia. Unsafe abortion can be caused by demographic risk factors such as young age, high parity, and lack of access to contraception and reproductive health information. In many developing countries, young boys and girls have less access to relevant information about reproductive health, and less or no access to contraception, leading to high rates of unsafe abortion. The legal status of abortion also impacts access to safe abortion care, with 25% of the world population living in countries where induced abortion is prohibited except to save the life of the pregnant woman or without explicit exception. In contrast, 40% of the world population lives in countries where induced abortion is permitted on request of the woman, with many countries having gestational age limits. Elective abortion care has significant differences among countries, with some countries considering socio-medical factors or adverse social conditions as indicators for induced abortion. In developed countries, access to safe abortion care is more readily available, while in developing countries, lack of access to safe abortion care is a major problem, leading to high rates of unsafe abortion.",multi-hop reasoning,Maternal_Child_Healthcare.pdf

"Considering the factors that affect the selection of contraceptive methods, such as effectiveness, acceptability, interference with sexual activity, availability, side effects, and reversibility, and the importance of counseling and access to services, how does the use of barrier methods compare to other contraceptive methods in terms of their benefits and risks, and what are the implications for family planning programs?","Barrier methods, while not as effective as other methods in preventing pregnancy, provide an important non-contraceptive benefit by protecting against HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases. The use of barrier methods compared to other contraceptive methods depends on various factors such as individual circumstances, medical condition, and lifestyle. For example, the IUD is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, mainly in women who are at risk of developing sexually transmitted diseases. In contrast, hormonal methods like the pill have a higher risk of side effects such as blood clots and stroke. The benefits and risks of each method must be carefully weighed, and counseling by family planning providers can help reduce the risks. Family planning programs should provide a range of methods to meet varying family planning needs throughout the life cycle and for both women and men, and access to services should be available in both public and private health facilities and through community-based distribution networks.
