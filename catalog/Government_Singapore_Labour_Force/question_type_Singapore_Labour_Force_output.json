                        "The decline in the incidence of fixed-term contract employees across most age, sex, and education groups in Singapore in 2022 was driven by a combination of factors. Firstly, the scale-back of pandemic-related contract jobs led to a more pronounced decline in the incidence of fixed-term contract employees in sectors that had earlier seen larger increases, such as Public Administration & Defence, Accommodation, Health & Social Services, and Real Estate Services. Secondly, the tight labour market in 2022 contributed to a decline in the incidence of fixed-term contract employees in growth sectors like Professional Services, Financial & Insurance Services, and Information & Communications. This decline was also driven by improvements in the educational profile of the workforce, which led to a higher share of professionals, managers, executives & technicians (PMETs) among employed residents. As a result, the proportion of fixed-term contract employees declined across most age, sex, and education groups. This shift towards more permanent employment arrangements had an impact on the overall employment landscape, as it reflected a more stable and secure job market. The tight labour market also contributed to a robust increase in median income for young resident tertiary graduates in employment, particularly for those in permanent jobs. Overall, the decline in fixed-term contract employees and the shift towards permanent employment arrangements suggest a strengthening of the job market in Singapore in 2022."

Additionally, the share of seniors in the labor force continued to rise, with a large increase in their labor force participation rate. This led to an increase in the employment rate of degree holders aged 25 to 64, with a firm and rising demand for manpower from sectors such as Information & Communication and Financial & Insurance Services. As a result, the median income of full-time employed degree holders rose to $8,190 in 2022, driven by the increased share of graduates in higher-skilled and higher-paying professional, managerial, and executive roles."
