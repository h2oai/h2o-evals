# Sample Questions

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the main issue that inhibits the mitigation of vulnerabilities in the "DFS over telecom" ecosystem?

**Answer:** The main issue that inhibits the mitigation of vulnerabilities in the "DFS over telecom" ecosystem is a misalignment of interests and misplaced liability between the telecom and financial regulators.
