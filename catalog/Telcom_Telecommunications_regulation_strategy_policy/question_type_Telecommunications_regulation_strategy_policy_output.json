In the context of telecommunications regulation, the cost of capital plays a key role in estimating and implementing regulated access prices, competition analysis, discounted cash flow models, license valuations, and business valuations. PwC's methodology for calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is based on the cost of debt, the cost of equity, and the funding structure in question.
