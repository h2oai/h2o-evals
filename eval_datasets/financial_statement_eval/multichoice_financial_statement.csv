For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated  corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion .  2Additional information  relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023  (unaudited) Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we  recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs  associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we  recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur  additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.

Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and  adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain  network equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal  year 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023  was a reduction in depreciation expense of  $988 million  and an increase in net income of $770 million , or $0.06  per basic and $0.06  per diluted share . Timing of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to  March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full  fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining  quarters of the year. Stock Repurchases On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional  $70.0 billion  of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its  stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading  prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares.

About non-GAAP financial measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP,  we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage  change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be  considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in  accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to  evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful  supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be  indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign  exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that  both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our  performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures  also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons  to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both  because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and  operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help  them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these  limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial  measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in  accordance with GAAP",Where can investors find more information about the company's financial performance and investor events?,"[""On the company's investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor)"", ""On Google's Keyword blog (https://www.blog.google/)"", 'On the SEC website (www.sec.gov)', 'On YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76CVRgZUfps)']",0,2023Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf

NON -GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non- GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income  (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss)  attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate managementâs internal comparisons to Teslaâs historical performance as  well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information  internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial  condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Teslaâs  performance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding  Teslaâs operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial information is provided above.
