Preface  I have been teaching Maternal and Child Health course, for Health  Officer,  Public Health Nursing, Clinical Nursing, and Midwifery students for the  last five years.  To prepare this  lecture note, specially for degree  students, I have tried to compile and emphasis on issues that the  students, specially health Officers, re commended as a) very relevant for  their future practice b) areas whic h are not given much emphasis in Gyn- Obs and paediatric attachments in relation to MCH Care c) to give less emphasis on topics focused on diploma programmes d) to give priority for selected issues as the time allocated for this course is   only 2 credit hours and the preparation of the lect ure note has to be governed by the  time allocated.  In preparing this lecture note, I have given serious concern for the time  allocated. As a result, emphasis is given on selected topics as MMR, PNM, abortion, family planning, ANC, anaemia. Due to this reason very  important topics such as ARI in ch ildren, child abuse, sexual violence  etc. cannot be included in the lect ure. But they are supposed to be  covered by assignments and group discussion. The contents of the lecture not e are gathered and compiled from a  variety of sources including notes  from my student days, books,  journals. from WHO manuals , bulletins  over the years. And I also took some issues, which I thought are very  descriptive, from my previous  colleagues in the Department of Community Health In GCMS.     ii   If the curriculum improves in terms of credit hour it is possible to improve  the content of this lecture not e by addressing questions like abuse,  violence, disability etc. iii                                          Acknowledgments  I want to thank the Carter Centre for helping me, through the Ethiopian  Public Health Imitative, in preparing th is lecture note.

In preparing this lecture note, I have given serious concern for the time  allocated. As a result, emphasis is given on selected topics as MMR, PNM, abortion, family planning, ANC, anaemia. Due to this reason very  important topics such as ARI in ch ildren, child abuse, sexual violence  etc. cannot be included in the lect ure.

The targets for MCH are all women in their reproductive age groups, i.e., 15 - 49 years of age, children, school age population and adolescents.     Throughout the world, especially in the developing countries, there is an  increasing concern and interest in maternal and child health care. This commitment towards MCH care gains further strength after the World  Summit for Children, 1991, which gav e serious consideration and outlined  major areas to be addressed in the provision of Maternal and Child Health Care services.    1.1 Justifications for the provision of MCH Care       Why should the care of mothers and children needs major consideration and  be part of every programme that is taking care of people’s health?  The important considerations  and justifications include:   Mothers and children make up over 2/3 of the whole population.   Women in reproductive age (15 – 49) constitute 21%, pregnant women, 4.5%, children under1 5, 47%, child ren under 5, 18%, under 3: 12%  and infants: 4%","What is the purpose of the note that the author took parts of for the Department of Community Health, according to the text?","['To provide an overview of maternal and child health care services.', 'To outline strategies for reducing maternal and child mortality rates.', 'To highlight the importance of school health services in MCH care.', ""To provide a reference for the Ministry of Health's immunization schedule.""]",0,Maternal_Child_Healthcare.pdf

(This working estimate is ve ry important in developing countries for   project planning and implementation)   Maternal mortality is an adverse  outcome of many pregnancies.   Miscarriage, induced abortion, and other factors, are causes for over  40 percent of the pregnancies in dev eloping countries to result in  complications, illnesses, or permanent disability for the mother or child. About 80 percent of maternal  deaths in are directed obstetric   Maternal and Child Health Care   2   deaths. They result ""from obstetric complications of the pregnant state  (pregnancy, labour, and puerperium), fr om intervention, omissions,  incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the  above.   • Most pregnant women in the developi ng world receive insufficient or  no prenatal care and deliver without help from appropriately trained health care providers. More than 7 million newborn deaths are believed to result from maternal health problems and their mismanagement.  • Poorly timed unwanted pregnancies ca rry high risks of morbidity and  mortality, as well as social and economic costs, particularly to the adolescent and many unwanted pregnancies end in unsafe abortion.   • Poor maternal health hurts wom en's productivity, their families'  welfare, and socio-economic development.  • Large number of women suffers severe chronic illnesses that can be  exacerbated by pregnancy and the mother's weakened immune system and levels of these illnesses are extremely high.  • Infectious diseases like malaria are more prevalent in pregnant  women than in non-pregnant women (most common in the first pregnancy). In addition, an increasing number of pregnant women are testing positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. In Sub- Saharan Africa, 3 million women are estimated to be infected with the AIDS virus and a woman with HIV has a 25 to 40 percent chance of passing the infection on to her fetus in the womb or at birth.  • Many women suffer pregnancy-rela ted disabilities like uterine  prolapse long after delivery due to early marriage and childbearing and high fertility.  • Nutritional problems are severe among pregnant mothers and 60 to  70 percent of pregnant women in dev eloping countries are estimated  to be anaemic. Women with poor nutritional status are more likely to deliver a low-birth -weight infant.  • Majority of perinatal deaths are associated with maternal  complications, poor management techniques during labour and Maternal and Child Health Care   3   delivery, and maternal health and nutritional status before and  during pregnancy.  • The large majority of pregnancies that end in a maternal death also  result in fetal or perinatal deat h. Among infants who survive the  death of the mother, fewer than 10 percent live beyond their first  birthday.  • Ante partum haemorrhage, eclampsia, and other complications are  associated with large number of perinatal deaths each year in  developing countries plus considerable suffering and poor growth and development for those in fants who survive.   • Development impairments among children due to poor management  during labour and delivery.   • Low birth weight babies. Because many women are fed less, marry  early, carry a heavy workload, and spend a considerable portion of their lifespan in pregnancy and lact ation, they are exposed to  persistent low nutritional status  and high-energy expenditure. This  predisposes mothers to bear low-birth-weight infants.   • Women often lack access to relevant  information, trained providers  and supplies, emergency transport, and other essential services.  • Cultural attitudes and practices im pede women's use of services that  are available.  • Children whose earliest years are faced by hunger or disease or  whose minds are not stimulated by appropriate interaction with adults and their environment w ill experience grave and negative  consequence throughout their lives- and so does society as they  would be less contributory member",What percentage of the population consists of mothers and children?,"['2/3', '1/3', '1/2', '3/4']",0,Maternal_Child_Healthcare.pdf

Maternal health problems are also the causes for more than seven million pregnancies to result in st illbirths or infant deaths within the  first week of life. Maternal death, of a woman in reproductive age, has a  further impact by causing grave ec onomic and social hardship for her  family and community. Other than thei r health problems most women in  the developing countries lack access to  modern health care services and  increases the magnitude of death from preventable problems.     2.3 Factors Affecting Heal th Status of Mothers    The major determinants of maternal morbidity and mortality include  pregnancy, the development of pr egnancy-related complications,  including complications from abortion and, the management of  pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum per iod. However, a lot of factors  contribute to the low health status of women in the developing countries  including Ethiopia. These factors include:  Maternal and Child Health Care   8   • Socio economic development of t he country has serious Impact on  morbidity and mortality.   • Poor agricultural development results in inadequate household food  and has direct influence on nutriti onal status of mothers.     Maternal death often has a number of interlined causes, which may start  as early as birth or in early childhood.  For example, a girl who is not fed  properly during her early years will be stunted and therefore more likely  to have obstructed labour. Also, a wom an’s risk of dying from infection  and haemorrhage is increased consider ably when being malnourished.          • Poor sanitary environment, poor housing, unsafe and inadequate  water, adverse social and physical environment.    • Access to health services.    Lack of access to modern health care services has great impact on  increasing maternal death.

These factors include:  Maternal and Child Health Care   8   • Socio economic development of t he country has serious Impact on  morbidity and mortality.   • Poor agricultural development results in inadequate household food  and has direct influence on nutriti onal status of mothers.     Maternal death often has a number of interlined causes, which may start  as early as birth or in early childhood.  For example, a girl who is not fed  properly during her early years will be stunted and therefore more likely  to have obstructed labour. Also, a wom an’s risk of dying from infection  and haemorrhage is increased consider ably when being malnourished.          • Poor sanitary environment, poor housing, unsafe and inadequate  water, adverse social and physical environment.    • Access to health services.    Lack of access to modern health care services has great impact on  increasing maternal death. Most  pregnant women do not receive  antenatal care; deliver without the assistance of trained health  workers etc. Less than 10% of  women in Ethiopia and many  countries of Africa & Asia get Family planning services.    •    Access to education     In many countries women have poor education and 2/3 of illiterate  adults are women. Poor education of  women has to be given serious  consideration. Because denial of education indicates that women are  denied the role they can play in  decision-making and decreases the  extent of contribution to their liv es, family and community",How can MCH services be expanded in developing countries?,"['By providing access to modern healthcare services and trained health workers.', 'By improving sanitation and hygiene practices in communities.', 'By increasing access to education for women.', 'By promoting the use of traditional medicine and home remedies.']",0,Maternal_Child_Healthcare.pdf

Because denial of education indicates that women are  denied the role they can play in  decision-making and decreases the  extent of contribution to their liv es, family and community. Education  is proved to have significant effect on women's health and reproductive behaviour through its influence on age at marriage, contraception and health care use, and awareness of risks and danger signs.    • Women’s reproductive and health behaviour.  Maternal and Child Health Care   9         Reproductive and health behaviour involves, for example, the age at  which a woman becomes pregnant, whether the pregnancy is wanted, and what kind of health care the woman seeks.  • Access to and control of income and resources  Women's income, access to household resources, and power to  make decisions influence their ability to seek and utilize health  services.   • Political commitment  Political commitment is crucial to allocate the available resources  and to provide services which are accessible to those most in need.    • Low social status of women   The health and well being of women is related and highly influenced  with their social status .   “Poor, Powerless, Pregnant” This is the status of women as labelled  by a global survey in 1988.  Large number of women (about 50% ) and girls in the world live  under conditions that threaten t heir health, deny them a choice  about child bearing, limit their educat ional attainment, restrict their  economic participation and fail to guarantee them equal rights as compared to men.  Low social status leads to sever burden & over work (Conjugal, maternal, domestic, and profe ssional) exposing to physically  demanding activities.    Although all factors in the framewor k are likely to influence maternal  morbidity and mortality as well as the health all women (and newborns), some have greater impact in the short term, particularly  on the incidence of maternal death.     It is always important to addre ss the above-mentioned factors, as  women need to be physically, mentally & socially healthy to fulfil Maternal and Child Health Care   10   their reproductive duty safely and e fficiently and to be a contributing  member of their community.    Some indicators of health status of women in Ethiopia    • Maternal mortality rate: 500 – 700 per 100,000  • Malnutrition among women in reproductive age group: 17%   • Total fertility rate:  6.2  • Teen-age pregnancy: 20%  • Low birth weight deliveries: 17%  • Weight gains during pregnancy:  5-6 KGs  • Ante natal care utilization: 20%  • Deliveries assisted by trained health worker: 14%  • Family planning coverage less than 10%    2.2 Maternal Mortality    2.2.1 General Consideration    Maternal mortality is defined as t he death of a woman while pregnant or  within 42 days of termination of pr egnancy irrespective of the site and  duration of pregnancy from any acutel y related to or aggravated by the  pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental  causes.              Maternal mortality is the leadi ng cause of death among women of  reproductive age in most of the dev eloping world. Globally, an estimated  500,000 women die as a result of pregnanc y each year.

Maternal and Child Health Care   11   Maternal mortality constitutes a sm all part of the larger maternal  morbidity and suffering, because for every maternal death there are a lot of women suffering from acute and chronic illnesses during pregnancy, delivery and 6 weeks after.    Most of the deaths, 99%, are in dev eloping countries the magnitude of  maternal death is very high in Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia, where  material mortality ratios (materia l deaths per 100,000 live births) may be  as much as 200 times higher than those in industrial countries.

The risk of maternal mortality is also  related to the mother’s previous  health and nutritional status, issues of gender discrimination, and access  to health services. Adolescent pregnancy carries a higher risk due to the danger of incomplete development of the pelvis, and there is a higher  prevalence of hypertensive diso rders among young mothers. Frequent  pregnancies also carry a higher risk of maternal and infant death.  Concern for maternal mortality is not onl y for the mother’s life.

The risk of maternal mortality is also  related to the mother’s previous  health and nutritional status, issues of gender discrimination, and access  to health services.

In countries like Rwanda  18.30% of women who came for Ante Natal Care were found to be HIV positive in a routine screening. This condition is further aggravated as a  woman with AIDS has a 25-40% chanc e of passing on HIV in the womb  or at birth (the number of children born with HIV is reported to be 3.8  million).     The Ministry of Health reported that chance, of transmitting in the uterus,  for an Ethiopian woman is 35%.

Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)    The spread of AIDS is increasing and rapid specially in sub-Saharan  Africa and other developing countri es putting stress on the already  strained health care system. Magnitude According to the WHO estimate16, 000 people are infected every day and   there are 3 million infected women and it is becoming a serious threat and alarmingly increasing in pr egnancy. In countries like Rwanda  18.30% of women who came for Ante Natal Care were found to be HIV positive in a routine screening. This condition is further aggravated as a  woman with AIDS has a 25-40% chanc e of passing on HIV in the womb  or at birth (the number of children born with HIV is reported to be 3.8  million).     The Ministry of Health reported that chance, of transmitting in the uterus,  for an Ethiopian woman is 35%.     With the current state of spread and infection rate, in few years time,  AIDS is expected to be the major cause of maternal mortality.     Poverty is also related with AIDS and as a cause of death. Some of the  reasons are:  • Poor health care  • Poor availability of drugs for pr otection of immunity and increasing  survival Immunity  • Crowding (increases transmission)  • Malnutrition further lowers immunity for common diseases like water  borne infections  etc",What is the impact of malaria during pregnancy?,"['Severe anemia, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, stillbirth, and low birth weight.', ' Congenital anomalies, mental retardation, and blindness.', ' Preterm labor, liver failure, and severe hemorrhage.', ' Increased risk of getting malaria, cerebral malaria, and severe anemia.']",0,Maternal_Child_Healthcare.pdf

VVF is commonly due to obstructed labour, which is most  common among women   • Who are stunted due to chronic mal nutrition or untreated infections  in childhood and adolescence, or   • Among women experiencing their first pregnancy at a young age,  prior to complete pelvic growth.  Women who suffer VVF continuously leak urine, and sometimes feces.  They typically become soci al outcasts; divorced and rejected,  they often travel long distances in search of treatment.  The  prevalence is particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa.     In Ethiopia, the Fistula hospita l has done 15,000 repairs in about 25  years.     In India, the numbers are decreasing with the development of peripheral  maternity services and improved communications. Community awareness and support for transfer of women in prolonged labour is crucial in decreasing the pr evalence of obstructed labour.     Serious problems are encountered by most women after developing  fistula. The problems range from rejection by husbands, and ostracised  by their community for life if untreated to self-loathing    2.2.2.4.    Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (Toxaemia of  Pregnancy)    These include eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, which are occurring only  during pregnancy (after 20 weeks gestati on) as a result of pregnancy- Maternal and Child Health Care   23   induced hypertension.     Early stage pre-eclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure,  generalized edema (swelling), and excess protein in the urine, may arise in the second or third trimester and is most common among primiparas.   Eclampsia is characterized by ve ry high blood pressure, convulsions,  and possible cerebral haemorrhage.  Untreated pre-eclampsia leads to eclampsia in less than 1 percent of pregnant women, but the condition is  serious and the outcome poor.  Immediate transfer and treatment, including expedited delivery, are required.        Between 5 and 17 percent of eclampsia victims die, and those who survive may suffer paralysis, blindness, or chronic hypertension and kidney damage.      Eclampsia can happen at any time during the latter part of pregnancy, it can and often does result in fetal death or the birth of a premature infant  at high risk of death.  Hy pertension and pre-eclampsia can also result in  low-birth-weight infants or fetal death.      The detection and management of hyper tensive disorders of pregnancy  depend on a continuum of services fr om prenatal care through routine  and emergency care around the time delivery.    Much of the reduction in fatalitie s in industrialized countries may be  attributed to improved medical support for the critically ill patient and the  increased use, effectiveness and sa fety of methods of expediting  delivery, including induction of  labour and operative delivery.    The most basic requirement for adequat e attention to hypertension in  pregnancy is blood pressure monitoring by trained personnel during prenatal care.

Training of health care providers to take blood pressure measurements in a reliable, unbiased fashion can be difficult.

Early stage pre-eclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure,  generalized edema (swelling), and excess protein in the urine, may arise in the second or third trimester and is most common among primiparas.   Eclampsia is characterized by ve ry high blood pressure, convulsions,  and possible cerebral haemorrhage.  Untreated pre-eclampsia leads to eclampsia in less than 1 percent of pregnant women, but the condition is  serious and the outcome poor.  Immediate transfer and treatment, including expedited delivery, are required.        Between 5 and 17 percent of eclampsia victims die, and those who survive may suffer paralysis, blindness, or chronic hypertension and kidney damage.      Eclampsia can happen at any time during the latter part of pregnancy, it can and often does result in fetal death or the birth of a premature infant  at high risk of death.  Hy pertension and pre-eclampsia can also result in  low-birth-weight infants or fetal death.      The detection and management of hyper tensive disorders of pregnancy  depend on a continuum of services fr om prenatal care through routine  and emergency care around the time delivery.    Much of the reduction in fatalitie s in industrialized countries may be  attributed to improved medical support for the critically ill patient and the  increased use, effectiveness and sa fety of methods of expediting  delivery, including induction of  labour and operative delivery.    The most basic requirement for adequat e attention to hypertension in  pregnancy is blood pressure monitoring by trained personnel during prenatal care.  The serial measurement  of blood pressure is not always  simple, but it is an important measurement.  Training of health care providers to take blood pressure measurements in a reliable, unbiased fashion can be difficult.  In-service training to maintain accuracy in Maternal and Child Health Care   24   recording measurements and intelligent interpretation of results and  subsequent diagnosis are important factors in the prevention of  eclampsia.    In addition, community education should be conducted to improve knowledge of the danger signs of severe pre-eclampsia and the importance of seeking care immediat ely in the case of convulsions.
