Article 16 TFEU provides a legal basis for the protection of individuals, and Article 114 TFEU provides a legal basis for the free movement of AI-based goods and services. By choosing these legal bases, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union aimed to create a uniform legal framework for the development, placing on the market, putting into service, and use of artificial intelligence systems in the Union, while preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing, and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorized by this Regulation.'}, {'text': 'The choice of legal basis impacts the scope and application of the Regulation.
