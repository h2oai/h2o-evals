"Immigration in Singapore       Background paper to the World Development Report 2023: Migrants, Refugees, and Societies       April 2023      Jessica Pan and Walter Theseira*     Abstract     International migration has been central to the emergence and development of modern Singapore .  Throughout Singapore’s history, immigration policy has been used as a deliberate tool to grow and  augment the resident labor force to promote economic growth  by relieving labor force constraints  across  all parts of  the skil l distribution. This paper begins with a  historical overview of immigration policies  in Singapore to provide the economic and sociopolitical context for the development of Singapore’s approach toward immigration. It then turns to a more in -depth discussion  of the mechanics and rationale  behind the  unique set of current immigration policies to (1) manage the flow and numbers of foreign  workers —most of whom are temporary low -skilled migrants , alongside  smaller numbers of medium-   and high- skilled migrants ; (2) attract  foreign students ; and (3) enable permanent residence and  naturalization. Finally, the paper discusses the economic and social impacts of Singapore’s foreign  worker policy and outline s several challenges that could emerge in the near future . These challenges  relate to the impact of skill- based immigration on the economic insecurity of residents in the context of  rapid technological change, the continued high reliance of many sectors on low -skilled foreign  manpower, and the difficulty o f adapting and reinventing assimilation policies in a multiethnic society.

Next, it discus ses the policy mechanisms behind immigration policy, segmented into immigration   favoring high- skilled migrants , which targets the long- term selective assimilation of migrants in the  upper tier of the skills and earnings distr ibution and who have the potential to readily integrate socially  into Singapore, and low -skilled or low -wage immigration, characterized  by transience and the absence  of pathways to assimilation. The economic consequences of immigration, including impacts on the  employment, labor  supply, skills , and sectoral allocation  of Singapore  residents (citizens and permanent  residents) , and on industrial structure and productivity, are noted. It also discusses the experience of  Singapore citizens with circular migration for study and work, and policies that facilitate such flows.     Finally, it concludes by examining three serious limitations to Singapore's immigration policy in the  near future, centering on the structural economic insecurity faced by the Singapore citizen labor  force  in the presence of technological change and open high -skilled immigration policy ; the inability of the  economy to wean itself off low -wage, low -skilled migrant labor ; and the challenges Singapore faces in  reinventing it self when long -term migrant  assimilation has thus far simply replicated the  colonial -era  societal status quo.     Overview of immigration policies     Historical developments before independence     Soon after assuming control over the island at the tip of the Malay peninsula, the British began  encouraging large -scale immigration to provide labor at the trading port, for public works, and for the  plantations in the hinterland. The first recorded population statistic of modern Singapore reported a  population of 10,683 in 1824—“entirely as a result of migrational surplus” (Arumainathan 1973). The  population grew rapidly over the next hundred years at an annual compound rate of 3.77 percent , fueled  almost entirely by migration, and the 1931 Census recorded a populat ion of 557,745 (Arumainathan  1973) . The Great Depression resulted in a severe but brief shock to labor demand in the early 1930s  (Choy and Sugimoto 2013), and precipitated a large -scale repatriation exercise of unemployed migrants  to their sources in China  and India, briefly reversing population growth with a net outflow of some  389,000 migrants from British Malaya ( Arumainathan 1973) .2 However, the economy soon rebounded,  and despite the introduction of immigration regulations with the Aliens Ordinance of 1933 that imposed  a quota system on male migrants , the overall population nearly doubled immediately before the second  world war. A novel source of growth during this period was from female migrants from China, who  were not regulated by policy, and who formed 41.3 percent  of the total estimated 460,000 Chinese  migrants from 1934  to 1938 (Arumainathan 1973).   3   Natural increase was an insignificant —and indeed negative —factor in population growth in  Singapore’s early years, due to gender imbalance s in the population and high mortality rates. It was not  until just after the second world war that natural increase became the major source of population growth,  in the wake of policies that further regulated formerly unrestricted immigration (Yeoh and  Lin 2012),  and due to high fertility rates during the post -war baby boom. The dramatic increase in the female  population, due in part to their preferential status under immigration policy starting in the 1930s, also contributed to natural growth. Whil e in 19 31, there were only 118,000 women of child- bearing age and  the overall sex ratio was 1.7 males to females, by 1957 there were some 314,000 women of child-bearing age and the sex ratio was just above 1.1 (Arumainathan 1973). The  Singapore -born started to  form the majority of the population, and immigration became restricted largely to West Malaysia. By  the first post -independence Census in 1970, natural increase accounted for 94.8  percent  of intercensal  population growth from 1957 to 1971, and 74",What are the two types of immigration policies in Singapore?,"['High-skilled immigration and low-skilled immigration', 'Immigration favoring high-skilled migrants and low-skilled or low-wage immigration', 'Transient immigration and assimilation immigration', 'Colonial-era immigration and modern immigration']",1,Immigration_in_Singapore.pdf

Therefore, work permit holders, other than  those who are likely to be absorbed into our permanent workforce, will gradually be phased out over that period. ” (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, 31 August 1982, vol. 42, col. 117–118) and by Mr .  Lee Yock Suan, the Minister of State for National Development : “Over the longer term, as the industry  upgrades, mechanizes and industrializes the resultant productivity growth will lessen the need for more manpower, especially foreign workers. It is still the aim of the Government to phase out foreign workers  in the construction workforce by 1991” (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, 18 March 1983, vol. 42, col.  1144–1145)",How did the government plan to assimilate migrants into the Singapore citizen population?,"['By granting permanent residence and eventual citizenship to migrants who raise the level of productivity.', 'By providing education and training to migrants to upgrade their skills and capabilities.', 'By requiring migrants to pass a language proficiency test in one of the official languages of Singapore.', 'By encouraging intermarriage between migrants and Singaporean citizens.']",0,Immigration_in_Singapore.pdf

To support the policy objective of calibrating and reducing the foreign workforce, the government  introduced the Foreign Worker Levy system  in 1982, where employers of prescribed categories of Work  Permit holders, generally in the lower wage and skill occupations, were required to pay monthly fees  to the government for each Work Permit holder employed (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, 31  August 1982, vol. 42, col. 117–118). The d ependency ratio ceiling (DRC) policy was also introduced  to limit the maximum permitted ratio of W ork Permit holders in an employer’s overall workforce. 9  5 Presumably, the intent was to use such policy levers to gradually phase out Work Permit holders in the  Singapore econo my.    However, as f igure 1 shows, throughout the 1980s, Singapore instead became increasingly more reliant  on the non- resident workforce, which grew from 3.2 percent  of the total workforce in 1970, to 11.09   percent  in 1980, and then 16.15 percent  in 1990 (Yeoh and Lin 2012) .10 Although detailed historic data  on the foreign composition of the workforce are not consistently available, Parliamentary records  suggest that Singapore's rapid industrialization and growth produced skills and labor shortages which  government policy sought to address by granting “permission for industrial concerns to bring in skilled  labor from outside Singapore” (Singapore Parliament Debates, 29 December 1969, vol. 29, col. 302) .

Note:  Residents include Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  The total workforce is the sum of the resident  and non -resident workforce  (that is, foreign workers who are holders of W ork Permits and E mployment Passes) .  The data from 2008 onward were revised to exclude Singapore residents (citizens and permanent residents ) who  have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.     In 1985, Singapore experienced a short  but sharp recession, precipitated in part by the government's  policy to upgrade the wages of the resident labor force to move the economy up the value chain (Goh  2009). The advantages of foreign labor in managing macroeconomic shocks became apparent once  more, as a source of highly mobile labor that could improve economic competitiveness by relieving  wage pressures, skills, and labor shortages during booms, and—crucially —bear the brunt of job market  restructuring in any busts. The 1985–1986 Economic Commit tee set up by the government to examine  and restructure the economy in the wake of the recession, headed by the future Prime Minister Lee  Hsien Loong, noted that Singapore “will require foreign workers to overcome temporary shortages,  and to work in jobs w here it has proven difficult to employ Singaporeans”  (Ministry of Trade and  Industry 1986). By 1990, the non- resident workforce rose to 248,200, or nearly 1 in 6 workers — suggesting that the government's original policy intent of aiming for “a wholly Singaporean workforce”  by then was well and truly dead— the occasional wishful thinking from politicians aside.     Since then, the policy has been to accept non -resident workers as a permanent feature of the Singapore  labor force, albeit one with acknowledged significant long- term structural, societal, and economic trade- offs. As the Finance Minister Richard Hu put it, delivering the post -recession Budget in 1988: “The key   6 to managing our economic growth is flexibility… We have therefore been using a pool of foreign  workers as a buffer to cope with business cycles and economic fluctuations.

This policy shift was precipitated by Singapore’s declining comparative advantage in lower - to  medium -skill industr ies, which drove Singapore’s rapid economic development in the 1960s and 1970s,  but which were rapidly being eroded by the increasing openness  and competitiveness  of regional  economies .

We must therefore welcome the infusion of knowledge which foreign talent will bring.  Singapore must become a cosmopolitan, global city, an open societ y where people from many lands  can feel at home” (Goh 1997) . To support these plans, Singapore rebranded itself as a “Talent Capital”  (Iwasaki 2015), and established a multi -ministry Singapore Talent and Recruitment (STAR) committee  in 1998 to attract and recruit highly skilled workers globally (Yap 1999). Supporting these broader labor market schemes, efforts also gathered pace to attract high -potential students to Singapore, both through  Singapore government -sponsored scholarship progra ms for study in loc al educational institutions, as  well as through the “Global Schoolhouse ” project , which aimed to make Singapore a hub for  international universities.    The shift in policy to embrace high -skilled immigration and assimilation soon began to bear fruit.  Before  discussing the statistics, it is useful to clarify how the Singapore government typically classifies  different groups of the population. The breakdown is usually provided in terms of residency (instead of  country of origin), where “residents” refers to individuals who are Singapore citizens or permanent  residents, while “non- residents” refers to foreigners working or studying in Singapore as well as their  dependents ( that is , non- citizen/non -permanent residents). The “resident” category includes naturalized  citizens as well as permanent residents who do not have citizenship, whereas the “non -resident”  category includes only foreigners who do not have the legal right to permanent residence in Singapore.  This dist inction is used because the government views the resident population as the relevant statistic  for understanding many economic and social aspects of the country, where the presumption is that the  vast majority of the non- resident population who work or study in Singapore are transient and expected  to return eventually to their countries of origin. 12 Unfortunately, there are few official statistics on the  breakdown of the foreign- born population within the resident category. An exception are the statistics  provided by international organizations such as the U nited Nations  (UN) that report the size of the  foreign- born population (or migrant stock, using their terminology) , which will be discussed later in the  paper .    As figure 1 shows, the non -resident labor f orce grew from 248,200 workers in 1990 to more than one   million workers in 2008, comprising more than one -third ( 34.41  percent ) of the total workforce. While  the growth of the resident workforce was relatively more stab le, at approximately 38,000 workers p er  year, the non- resident workforce exhibited significant fluctuations, including flat or negative growth in  the aftermath of economic recessions caused by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the dot com crash of 2000–01, and the 2003 SARS outbreak.     Although a detailed breakdown is not consistently available, a substantial portion of resident labor force  growth during t he late 1990s onward can be attributed to the assimilation of  migrants.

The result from this era was the bifurcation of foreign labor policy into a “Foreign Talent” strategy,  where high- skilled  workers were welcomed, actively recru ited, and targeted for long- term assimilation,  and a “Foreign Worker” strategy, where low -skilled workers were tolerated due to economic necessity,  but carefully managed for the undesirable social and economic trade -offs. Policies were further refined  in 2004 to recognize that  immigration policy based on a strict bifurcation of skills  did not suit the  economy’s need for “manpower at the diploma and post -secondary level” (Singapore Parliamentary  Debates, 27 Feb ruary  2004, vol. 77, col. 463– 464).

Throughout this period, the foreign worker levy and dependency ratio ceiling were continually adjusted  to calibrate the flow of, and demand for, low -skilled  workers, while the approval criteria for high- skilled  workers’ Employment Passes, consisting largely of income and qualification checks, was likewise adjusted to ensure that incoming workers, as far as possible, filled positions that required skills that  were relatively rare in the resident population.

At the lower -skilled end, there was increasing concern that Singapore citizen  low-wage workers were  experiencing wage suppression from the ready availability of W ork Permit  holders, who were generally  willing to work for lower effective wages than citizens. Work Permit holders were also, increasingly,  blamed for social ills such as crime or disorderly public behavior. At the high- skilled end, the rapid  growth in migrant  high-skilled workers led to keen competition for Professional, Managerial, Executive ,  and Technical (PMET) jobs, which were demanded by an increasingly well -educated  Singapore citizen   workforce.

In 2011, the so- called “watershed” general election ( Adam and Lim 2011) saw the ruling party's voter  share fall from 66.6 percent  in 2006 to only 60.14 percent . More Opposition MPs were elected than at  any time since independence , a stunning result given the ruling party’s hitherto uninterrupted  dominance in the polls and Parliament .17 Voters expressed discontent, not just towa rd foreign  employment in general, but also toward the pressures placed on housing prices, overcrowding in public  10 transport, and other strains believed to be caused by rapid population growth. In 2013, the government  announced a long- term population strategy under the ""White Paper on Population"" which outlined that  a projected total population of 6.9 million could exist by 2030, supplemented by a non- resident  population of 2.9 million to 3.1 million and an increase in new citizenship and permanent residents  (PRs) granted ( National Population and Talent Division 2013). The release of the White Paper sparked  significant public debate and even a large -scale protest attended by 5,000 people in opposition to the  White Paper ( Goh and Mokhtar 2013 ). While the White Paper was subsequently accepted by Parliament  (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, 8 February 2013, vol. 90), the government, perhaps chastened by  popular discontent, nonetheless took steps in the years ahead to disassociate population policy from t he  White Paper, even publicly refuting any policy intent to establish a “population target ” for Singapore .18    Given these clear signals that the Singapore citizen population were becoming averse to an increasingly  foreign workforce, and to rapid immigration- driven population growth in general, the government took  measures to tighten its foreign worker policy. In 2011, an Employment Pass eligibility certificate was  scrapped; it had previously allowed foreign professionals who have or had held specific university  degrees or other country’s skilled migrant visas to remain in Singapore to find a job for up to one  year  (Yeoh and Lam 2016) . The Ministry of Manpower (MOM; previously the Ministry of Labour) revised  its Employment Pass scheme by tightening its eligibility requirements ; these took effect in 2012. The  qualifying salaries of the P2 P ass rose from S$4,000 to S $4,500, while that of the Q1 Pass was revised  upward from S$2,800 to at least S$3,000 if the applicant is “ young” and from a “ good quality institution ,”  while older applicants would need to earn more than S$3,000 to qualify for the Q1 Pass (MOM 2011b) .  On the other hand, from 2011 to 2013, the foreign worker levy was raised for S Pass and W ork P ermit  holders. Employers incurred an increase of S $190 of levies per Tier 1 S Pass holder or an increase of  S$300 per Tier 2 S Pass holder , while the levy tier for Tier 1 S  Pass holders was tightened from 20   percent  to 10 percent . Meanwhile, Work Permit holders’ levies were raised by S $320, S$260, and S$160  for construction, manufacturing and services sectors , respectively. Across the board, while the  dependency ratio ceilin g remained constant, the levy tiers were tightened such that firms with a higher  dependence on foreign workers holding S Passes or Work Permits would incur higher business costs  per foreign worker hired (MOM 2011a) .    As figure 1 shows, the growth of the non- resident workforce plateaued toward the mid- 2010s, rising  from  1.044 million worke rs in 2009 and levelling off around 1.415 million in 2016, while  assimilation  into the resident workforce slowed dramatically, with new citizen and permanent resident gra nts  slowing to an average of about 20,000 and 30,000 a year , respectively",What was the percentage of voter share that the ruling party received in the 2011 general election?,"['60.14 percent', '66.6 percent', '50 percent', '40 percent']",0,Immigration_in_Singapore.pdf

In tandem with measures to slow  or halt foreign workforce growth, inflows of the foreign student population were also reduced, from  100,000 in 2008 to about 84,000 in 2012 (Davie 2010, in part because policies to develop Singapore as  an international student hub were recalibrated to assure Singaporeans that their opportunities for places  in government -subsidized higher education institutions would not be compromised (see discussion i n  the next section ).    Immigration polic ies in Singapore     This section describes the immigration policies in Singapore in greater detail. Immigration policies in  Singapore can be broadly classified into three  main categories : (1) policies regarding the foreign labor  force ; (2) policies to attract foreign students ; and (3) permanent  residence and naturalization . Foreign  workers are by far the largest source of migrant inflow into Singapore ; as such, the bulk of the policy  and popular discussion surrounding immigration policy in Singapore typically concerns this group of  economic migrants.

Tripartism  operates  through councils and committees that contain representatives from  the tripartite stakeholders  to formulate and advise on —among other things —wage policy19 and labor   market reforms .20 Singapore also closely engages foreign investors and multinational enterprises  through the Economic Development Board, Singapore’s external economic development agency, and  has prioritized being “ [responsive] to changes in the international economy and the  resulting  requirements of [foreign enterprises]”  (Huff 1995).21    Singapore has historically depended on foreigners to supplement its resident  labor force  and maintain  economic competitiveness and growth (Yap 2014) . With relatively low resident unemploymen t rates  (generally around 3 percent  in nonrecession ary times), foreign workers have been relied upon to fill   labor shortages and to serve as a buffer to smooth employment demand during economic cycles.  Moreover, demographic considerations such as the rising educational profile of Singapore  citizens, low  fertility, the rapidly aging population, and the entry of women into the labor force  has also led to the  reliance on foreign manpower to augment  the size of the workforce, fill gaps in certain sectors and  occupations, keep production costs low, and provide care services within the household.    The approach to managing foreign labor in Singapore differs  substantially  by the skill  level of migrants.  Low-skilled migrants are viewed as temporary guest workers and are allowed to work in the country  under strict conditions and are expected to leave the country when their job contract expires. These  migrants are subject to stringent social and economic controls; for example, they cannot bring their  families to Si ngapore, are  often  required to reside in employer -provided housing , and are required to  pass regular medical examinations to maintain their work status.

Medium -skilled migration  is granted through S Passes, which are targeted at  foreigners  who earn a monthly salary of more than S$3,000, but less than S $5,000, with a degree or diploma, and  who have relevant work experience.22    Inflow of foreign workers through the WP  and S Pass  scheme is managed by a combination of quantity  and price controls. Employer quotas are based on sector -specific dependency ratio ceilings that specify  the ratio of foreign workers to the total workforce  that the firm is allowed to employ. Employers also  have to pay a monthly foreign- worker levy that varies by sector, source country, and skill -level of the  migrant. For S Pass holders, the policy objective of the qualifying wage criteria is to “ensure that  Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders are comparable in quality to the top one -third of our local  PMET and APT workforce respectively. The qualifying salaries and levies will be raised accordingly  to meet this benchmark”  (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, 7 Mar ch 2022, vol. 95). Appendix A  provides details on the current framework for hiring low-skilled and medium -skilled temporary foreign  workers , as well as professionals .    The main rationale that policy makers cite for these mechanisms to regulate the supply of low -skilled  foreign workers in Singapore is to balance the need to supplement the labor force to sustain economic  growth while keeping production costs reasonable, and at the same time to avoid exc essive reliance on  the foreign workers. Policy makers have sought to minimize possible labor market effects on Singapore  citizen  workers in the form of diminished job opportunities for low -skilled Singapore  citizens and the  likelihood that access to low -cost foreign labor might crowd out firm incentives to invest in labor -saving,  productivity- enhancing, technologies (Peri 2014). The use of the dependency ratio  ceiling  serves as a   13 control to preserve resident jobs even in sectors that are highly dependent on  foreign workers by limiting  outright substitution and/or promoting complementarity between resident workers and foreign workers.     In the past 30 years, the Singapore government has actively used both the foreign worker levy and the  dependency ratio ceiling to achieve longer -term policy aims , as well as to manage the short -term flow  of labor in response to economic cycles and other events",What is the purpose of the Work Permit (WP) scheme in Singapore?,"['To grant temporary work permits to low-skilled foreign workers.', 'To attract high-skilled professionals to work in Singapore.', 'To provide a pathway to permanent residency for foreign workers.', 'To regulate the supply of medium-skilled foreign workers.']",0,Immigration_in_Singapore.pdf
"On the other hand, Singapore has  generally adopted a relatively open immigration policy for skilled foreigners who wish to wor k in  Singapore, and generally accord them similar rights as residents. Skilled foreign workers are  encouraged to bring their families, and there is generally  a path to permanent residency or citizenship  for those who can demonstrate that they are willing t o sink their roots in Singapore  and continue to  contribute to the country.     Figure 3 shows the breakdown of Singapore’s foreign labor force by Pass type from 2009 to 2021. Low - skilled migrants in the form of Work Permit (WP) holders comprise the majority of foreign workers,  although their share in the foreign workforce has declined from more than 60 percent in 2009 to 50 percent in 2021. Foreign domestic helpers —another category of low -skilled migrants —accounted for  about 15 percent to 20 percent from 2009 to 2021. Medium -skilled workers (S -Pass holders) and high- skilled workers (Employment Pass holders) each comprise about 8 percent to 15 percent of the foreign workforce over the same period. The decline in the share of low -skilled foreign workers  from 2009 to  2012 was accompanied by an increase in the share of S -Pass and Employment Pass (EP) holders.        12 Figure 3 .

"In the past 30 years, the Singapore government has actively used both the foreign worker levy and the  dependency ratio ceiling to achieve longer -term policy aims , as well as to manage the short -term flow  of labor in response to economic cycles and other events. For example , as discussed,  the 2011 general  elections  led to a shift in immigration policy toward greater control meas ures in a bid to reduce  Singapore’s reliance on foreign workers. Subsequently, foreign worker levies for unskilled workers were increased across the board by between 20 percent  to 50 percent  (depending on the class of worker   and sector ) and dependency ratio ceilings in selected sectors were lowered  (MOM 2013) . The ability to  adjust prices and, hence, affect business costs quickly in response to external labor market conditions is well illustr ated by the series of foreign worker levy rebates that were rolled out during the COVID - 19 pandemic aimed at helping firms dependent on foreign workers manage manpower disruptions and  business costs during the pandemic.    Singapore also imports a large num ber of female low -skilled migrants  from neighboring countries to  provide live -in domestic help  as a means to ensure affordable child  care and elder  care to encourage   female residents to enter the labor force. The Foreign Maid Scheme was introduced in 1978 to facilitate  the hiring of domestic workers from regional countries beyond Malaysia  (where there were existing  immigration arrangements)  (Yeoh , Huang, and Gonzalez III 1999) . The strong local demand for such  workers, coupled with concurrent developments in the regional labor markets that depended heavily on  migrant remittances, led to a rapid rise in the number of foreign domestic workers (FDW s) in Singapore.  Today, there are about 250,000 FDWs in Singapore, or roughly one for  every six households.    FDWs are required to meet age, nationality, and education requirements to quality for a Work Permit.  They must  be female, between the ages of 23 to 50, have a minimum of 8 years of formal education,  and be from an approved source country or region. Once in Singapore, FDWs must work and live at the  employer’s home, are not allowed to engage in other work, and cannot change employers freely.  To  hire an FDW, employers also must meet several requirements. Employers need to be 21 years and above  and be financially solven t. They are also required to pay a monthly levy, with concessionary rates  available to older  employers  as well as those with disabilities, as well as employers  residing with young  children, o lder parents/grandparents, and/or disabled family members. 23 Employers who wish to hire  more than one FDW also need to demonstrate that they have significant care needs , such as having at  least two children below 18 years old or a parent/parent -in-law over  60 years old living in the same  household.      High -skilled m igration     High -skilled migration in Singapore is managed through the issuance of the Employment Pass (EP) that  allows foreigners with a job offer with a monthly salary of at least  S$5,000 to work in Singapore.

Singapore has established several criteria governing the issuance of the  EP to protect the resident labor  force. Employers must demonstrate  that they posted the job offer on the official online job portal   approved by the Singapore government25 and have fairly considered residents  for the role, before they  are eligible to apply  for the EP.  Compared to WP holders, EP holders are afforded greater flexibility.  EP (and S Pass)  holders who earn at least S$6,000 are allowed to bring their family members into  Singapore under a dependent’s P ass.

The  EP is meant for foreign professionals, managers, and executives  and is granted for a period of two  years  in the first instance, and thereafter is subjected to renewal on a three -year basis .24 The policy objective  for managing the EP qualifying salary is, like the S Pass, to maintain the quality of EP holders to be  comparable to the upper one -third of resident workers in the same skill category.     Singapore has established several criteria governing the issuance of the  EP to protect the resident labor  force. Employers must demonstrate  that they posted the job offer on the official online job portal   approved by the Singapore government25 and have fairly considered residents  for the role, before they  are eligible to apply  for the EP.  Compared to WP holders, EP holders are afforded greater flexibility.  EP (and S Pass)  holders who earn at least S$6,000 are allowed to bring their family members into  Singapore under a dependent’s P ass. Also, currently there is no quota on the number of EPs that can be  granted , and no limit on the countries that the EP holder can come from",What are the criteria governing the issuance of the EP in Singapore?,"['The employer must demonstrate that they have posted the job offer on the official online job portal approved by the Singapore government and have fairly considered residents for the role.', 'The foreign worker must have a minimum of 8 years of formal education and be from an approved source country or region.', 'The employer must pay a monthly levy, with concessionary rates available to older employers as well as those with disabilities, as well as employers residing with young children, older parents/grandparents, and/or disabled family members.', 'The foreign worker must be female, between the ages of 23 to 50, and have a minimum of 8 years of formal education.']",0,Immigration_in_Singapore.pdf
"In the past 30 years, the Singapore government has actively used both the foreign worker levy and the  dependency ratio ceiling to achieve longer -term policy aims , as well as to manage the short -term flow  of labor in response to economic cycles and other events. For example , as discussed,  the 2011 general  elections  led to a shift in immigration policy toward greater control meas ures in a bid to reduce  Singapore’s reliance on foreign workers. Subsequently, foreign worker levies for unskilled workers were increased across the board by between 20 percent  to 50 percent  (depending on the class of worker   and sector ) and dependency ratio ceilings in selected sectors were lowered  (MOM 2013) . The ability to  adjust prices and, hence, affect business costs quickly in response to external labor market conditions is well illustr ated by the series of foreign worker levy rebates that were rolled out during the COVID - 19 pandemic aimed at helping firms dependent on foreign workers manage manpower disruptions and  business costs during the pandemic.    Singapore also imports a large num ber of female low -skilled migrants  from neighboring countries to  provide live -in domestic help  as a means to ensure affordable child  care and elder  care to encourage   female residents to enter the labor force. The Foreign Maid Scheme was introduced in 1978 to facilitate  the hiring of domestic workers from regional countries beyond Malaysia  (where there were existing  immigration arrangements)  (Yeoh , Huang, and Gonzalez III 1999) . The strong local demand for such  workers, coupled with concurrent developments in the regional labor markets that depended heavily on  migrant remittances, led to a rapid rise in the number of foreign domestic workers (FDW s) in Singapore.  Today, there are about 250,000 FDWs in Singapore, or roughly one for  every six households.    FDWs are required to meet age, nationality, and education requirements to quality for a Work Permit.  They must  be female, between the ages of 23 to 50, have a minimum of 8 years of formal education,  and be from an approved source country or region. Once in Singapore, FDWs must work and live at the  employer’s home, are not allowed to engage in other work, and cannot change employers freely.  To  hire an FDW, employers also must meet several requirements. Employers need to be 21 years and above  and be financially solven t. They are also required to pay a monthly levy, with concessionary rates  available to older  employers  as well as those with disabilities, as well as employers  residing with young  children, o lder parents/grandparents, and/or disabled family members. 23 Employers who wish to hire  more than one FDW also need to demonstrate that they have significant care needs , such as having at  least two children below 18 years old or a parent/parent -in-law over  60 years old living in the same  household.
