Overview    (1) Organizations that are exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the  Internal Revenue Code and do not fall into any of the public charity statuses under Section 509(a) are called private foundations. Private foundations raise complex and interrelated issues regarding the application of Chapter 42.   A. Background / History    (1) Under Chapter 42, excise taxes are imposed on acts of self -dealing under  Section 4941. The taxes imposed under Section 4941 apply to certain acts  involving :   a.

Background / History    (1) Under Chapter 42, excise taxes are imposed on acts of self -dealing under  Section 4941. The taxes imposed under Section 4941 apply to certain acts  involving :   a. Private foundations ,  b. Certain charitable trusts described in Section 4947(a)(1) , and  c. Split-interest trusts described in Section 4947(a)(2).   (2) Prior to enactment of Section 4941, the Revenue Act of 1950 specified several  prohibited types of self -dealing transactions applicable to certain categories of  exempt organizations and to certain nonexempt charitable trusts. The prohibited transaction rules of 1950 imposed arm’s -length standards for certain specified  types of transactions between an organization and its creators or substantial donors and their families and controll ed corporations. The sanctions for  violating the standards included loss of exemption and denial of charitable contribution deductions .   (3) Under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the laws regarding the prohibited transaction rules were revised. Section 4941 was added to the Code to impose, in lieu of the former prohibited transactions rules, excise taxes on self -dealing  transactions between ""disqualified persons,"" defined in S ection 4946, and  private foundations. The tax is also imposed on the participation of any foundation manager in an act of self -dealing between a disqualified person and  a private foundation, knowing that it is such an act .  Note:  The Section 4941 self -dealing rules also apply to trusts described in  Section 4947(a)(1) that are treated as private foundations, trusts described in  Section 4947(a)(2), and taxable private foundations (see Treas ury Regulation  (Treas. Reg.) 1.509(b) -1(b)) .   (4) The general reasons for the changes are set forth in General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (December 3, 1970), JCS -16-70 at 30, prepared by the  Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation (“Explanation”). Paraphrasing the Explanat ion, arm’s -length standards require  disproportionately greater enforcement efforts, resulting in sporadic and uncertain effectiveness. These sanctions were sometimes ineffective and tended to discourage enforcement efforts. Conversely, in many cases the sanctions were so great compared to the offense that they caused reluctance in  enforcement, especially in view of the element of subjectivity in applying arm’s -  6   length standards. Where the IRS did seek to apply sanctions in such  circumstances, the same factor s encouraged extensive litigation and a  noticeable reluctance by the courts to uphold severe sanctions. Consequently,  as a practical matter, prior law didn’t preserve private foundations’ integrity .   (5) The 1969 Act generally prohibits self -dealing transactions and offers a variety  and progression of sanctions to:   a. Minimize the need to apply subjective arm’s -length standards,   b. Avoid the temptation to misuse private foundations for noncharitable  purposes,   c. Provide a more rational relationship between sanctions and improper acts,  and  d. Make it more practical to properly enforce the law.  JCS- 16-70 at 30- 31.   (6) The changes made in the 1969 Act were based on Congress’ belief that the highest fiduciary standards require nearly complete elimination of all self - dealing rather than relying on arm’s -length standards. Accordingly, Congress  set forth a regime to discourage self -dealing acts by imposing first and second  tier excise taxes on disqualified persons and foundation managers .   (7) The Pension Protection Act of 2006, P.L. 10 9-280 (PPA 2006), Section 1212,  doubled the rates of most first tier Chapter 42 excise taxes as well as the limits on foundation manager taxes. This includes excise taxes imposed by Section 4941. For Section 4941, the first tier tax is currently 10% of the amount involved  (with joint and several liability), and the foundation manager tax is currently 5%  of the amount involved (with joint and several liability, and a $20,000 maximum).

These sanctions were sometimes ineffective and tended to discourage enforcement efforts. Conversely, in many cases the sanctions were so great compared to the offense that they caused reluctance in  enforcement, especially in view of the element of subjectivity in applying arm’s -  6   length standards. Where the IRS did seek to apply sanctions in such  circumstances, the same factor s encouraged extensive litigation and a  noticeable reluctance by the courts to uphold severe sanctions. Consequently,  as a practical matter, prior law didn’t preserve private foundations’ integrity .   (5) The 1969 Act generally prohibits self -dealing transactions and offers a variety  and progression of sanctions to:   a. Minimize the need to apply subjective arm’s -length standards,   b. Avoid the temptation to misuse private foundations for noncharitable  purposes,   c. Provide a more rational relationship between sanctions and improper acts,  and  d. Make it more practical to properly enforce the law.  JCS- 16-70 at 30- 31.   (6) The changes made in the 1969 Act were based on Congress’ belief that the highest fiduciary standards require nearly complete elimination of all self - dealing rather than relying on arm’s -length standards.

Limited exceptions apply.   (9) Electronic filing requirements have not changed for Form 990- PF filers with tax  years beginning before July 2, 2019 (which includes calendar year 2019 Forms  990-PF). Required electronic filing for calendar year filers will apply for tax  years beginning in 2020 and later.   (10) There are new reporting standards for net assets, and Part II of Form 990- PF  was updated to reflect the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (FASB’s)  reclassification of net assets into two classes, net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions.   (11) The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act passed on December 20, 2019,  included legislation that reduced the 2%  excise tax on net investment  income of private foundations to 1.39% . At the same time, the legislation   7   repealed the 1% special rate that applied if the private foundation met certain  distribution requirements. The changes are effective for taxable years beginning  after December 20, 2019.   (12) For tax years beginning in 2020, an individual liable for a Chapter 42 excise tax  will not have the option to file jointly with the organization with respect to which  the excise tax relates. Beginning with tax year 2020, Form 4720, Return of  Certain Excise Taxes on Charities and Other Persons Under Chapters 41 and  42 of the IRC,  has been revised to identify whether the filer is the organization  or an individual. Accordingly, for tax years after 2019, an agent preparing Form 4720 to report individual excise tax liability during an audit will no longer convert  Form 4720 to “Form 4720- A.” The revenue agent will, instead, complete Form  4720 identifying the filer as an individual as described in the instructions for Form 4720.  Please see the instructions to the Form 4720 for further information.   B. Relevant Terms   (1) Disqualified Person:  Defined in Section 4946 ( and in greater detail in TG 63  Disqualified Persons as Defined in IRC 4946), a s basically an individual or  organization related to a private foundation as a substantial contributor (or 20% owner of a substantial contributor), a foundation manager, a member of their families, or certain entities 35% owned by the foregoing. For purposes of Section 4941 only, certain government officials are also disqualified persons .  (2) Self-Dealing:  Defined in Section 4941 as generally prohibit ing all direct and  indirect transactions between a private foundation and its disqualified persons.   See Section 4941(d)(1).   (3) Indirect Self -Dealing:  Defined in Section 4941 as generally a transaction (but  is not limited to) between an organization controlled by a private foundation and a disqualified person.  C. Law / Authority   (1) Section 4941 imposes an excise tax on any direct or indirect act of self -dealing  between a private foundation and a disqualified person. Self -dealing  transactions described under Section 4941(d) are:   a. The sale, exchange, or leasing of property  between a foundation and a  disqualified person,   b. The lending of money or other extension of credit  between a foundation and  a disqualified person,   c. The furnishing of goods, services, or facilities  between a foundation and a  disqualified person,   d. The payment of compensation or expenses (or reimbursement) by a  foundation to a disqualified person,    8   e. The transfer or use of the foundation’s income or assets by or for the  benefit of a disqualified person, and   f. Certa in payments to government officials  by a foundation.

The self -dealing transactions listed above are qualified by many special rules  and exceptions described throughout this Technical Guide.   (2) The excise taxes imposed by Section 4941 for engaging in one or more of the enumerated acts of self -dealing are assessed against the self -dealer and, in  appropriate cases, the foundation managers.   (3) The same act or transaction can give rise to liability for more than one Chapter 42 tax. For example, an act of self -dealing might also be an expenditure for a  non-charitable purpose taxable under Section 4945. See Kermit Fischer  Foundation v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990 -300, 59 T.C.M. (CCH) 898  (1990)  (Tax Court imposed excise tax on disqualified person under S ection  4941 and on private foundation under S ection 4945 for the same acts); Treas.

Requirements   (1) Section 4941 imposes an excise tax on certain direct and indirect financial  transactions bet ween a private foundation and its disqualified persons.   A. Definition of Self -Dealing   (1) Self-dealing means any direct or indirect transaction described in Section  4941(d)(1)  and not otherwise excepted. It is immaterial whether the transaction  benefits or is detrimental to the foundation. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -1(a).  (2) Generally, a disqualified person who participates in an act of self -dealing is  liable for the tax even though that person had no knowl edge at the time of the  act that the act constituted self -dealing. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(a) -1(a)(1). An  exception applies to certain government officials. Another exception applies to certain sales of securities between a foundation and disqualified pers on over an  exchange if:   a. The transaction takes place through a stockbroker where normal trading procedures on a stock exchange or recognized over -the-counter market are  followed;   b. Neither the buyer nor the seller knows the identity of the other party; and   c. The sale is made in the ordinary course of business and does not involve a block of securities larger than the average daily trading volume of that stock over the previous four weeks. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(a) -1(a)(1).   (3) The securities exchange exception discussed above does not apply if the disqualified person is a dealer in securities acting as a principal in the transaction; nor does it apply to the lending of money or other extension of credit.   (4) Self-dealing does not include a transaction between a pri vate foundation and a  disqualified person where the disqualified person status arises only because of such transaction. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -1(a). This is often referred to as  the “first bite” rule. For example, the bargain sale of property to a priv ate  foundation is not an act of self -dealing if the seller becomes a disqualified  person only because the bargain element of the sale caused the seller to become a substantial contributor. However, the first bite rule doesn’t apply after disqualified person status is established, such as in the case of a continuing act of self -dealing. See Private Letter Ruling (PLR) 9530032 (1995), which isn’t  precedential guidance, but illustrates this point.   B. Specific Acts of Self- Dealing   (1) Section 4941(d)(1) provides for six specific self -dealing acts between a private  foundation and its disqualified persons.   B.1. Sale or Exchange or Leasing of Property (Section 4941(d)(1)(A))    10   (1) Generally, any sale or exchange of property between a private foundation and a  disqualif ied person is an act of self -dealing. See Section 4941(d)(1)(A) and  Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -2(a). Consider the following situations :  a. A disqualified person’s sale of incidental supplies to a private foundation is an act of self -dealing regardless of the amount the foundation pays for the  incidental supplies. See Treas. Reg. 53",What is the definition of self-dealing?,"['Any financial transaction between a private foundation and a disqualified person that benefits the foundation.', 'Any direct or indirect transaction described in Section 4941(d)(1) and not otherwise excepted, regardless of whether it benefits or is detrimental to the foundation.', 'Any transaction between a private foundation and a disqualified person that involves a block of securities larger than the average daily trading volume of that stock over the previous four weeks.', 'Any transaction between a private foundation and a disqualified person where the disqualified person status arises only because of such transaction.']",1

The corporation conducted a redemption of the common stock. Some of the stock was owned by a private foundation. The corporation excluded its officers and directors from the redemption. The Court concluded that the redemption met the exception in Section 4941(d)(2)(F) because Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -3(d)(1) did not require  the shareholders who are officers or direc tors to be included in the redemption  program (in light of potential conflicts with securities laws), and the redemptions were no less than fair market value.   (6) A disqualified person’s transfer of real or personal property to a private  foundation is treated as a sale or exchange if the foundation:   a. Assumes a mortgage or similar lien which was placed on the property  before the transfer, or   b. Takes the property, subject to a mortgage or similar lien placed on it by the disqualified person, within the 10- year per iod ending on the date of transfer.  See Section 4941(d)(2)(A).   Note:  The term ""similar lien"" includes, but is not limited to, deeds of trust  and vendor’s liens, but doesn’t include any lien which is insignificant in relation to the fair market value of the property transferred. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -2(a)(2).   (7) In Gershman Family Foundation v. Commissioner , 83 T.C. 217 (1984)  acq.  1985- 2 C.B. viii, the court held that a disqualified person’s transfer of a  promissory note, secured by an all -inclusive tru st deed on property that is  subject to senior notes, to a private foundation was an act of self -dealing. The  court concluded that the statutory language ""subject to a mortgage or similar lien"" should be broadly construed to apply to transfers in which an i ndividual   12   may improperly benefit from a transaction even though there’s no clear and  immediate detriment to or relinquishment by the foundation. See also Rev. Rul. 78-395, 1978- 2 C.B. 270 ( a disqualified person's transfer to a private foundation  of real pr operty that is subject to a lien placed on the property by the  disqualified person within the 10- year period ending on the transfer date is an  act of self -dealing, even though the lien was created merely as part of a  multiphase financing plan begun more than 10 years earlier) ; Rev. Rul. 80 -132,  1980- 1 C.B. 255 (a disqualified person’s donation to a private foundation of a  life insurance policy subject to an outstanding loan made to the donor within the 10-year period ending on the date of the donation that was not insignificant in  relation to the value of the policy was an act of self -dealing) .  (8) Leasing property between a disqualified person and a private foundation is considered self -dealing except when a disqualified person leases property to a  foundation w ithout charge. A lease is considered to be without charge even  though the foundation pays for reasonable janitorial services, utilities or other maintenance costs it incurs for the use of the property, so long as the payment is not made directly or indirec tly to a disqualified person. See Treas. Reg.  53.4941(d) -2(b)(2).    (9) Certain binding leases of office space in effect on Oct. 9, 1969 (or renewals) to a foundation are excluded from self -dealing.

B.2. Lending of Money  or Other Extension of Credit (Section s  4941(d)(1)(B) and 4941(d)(2)(B))   (1) The lending of money or other extension of credit between a private foundation  and a disqualified person generally constitutes self -dealing.   (2) An act of self -dealing may occur if a private foundation and a disqualified  person enter into a debtor -creditor (or  creditor -debtor) relationship, either  directly or indirectly. For example, an act of self -dealing occurs where a third - party  purchases property and assumes a mortgage, the mortgagee of which is  a private foundation, and subsequently the third party transf ers the property to a  disqualified person who either assumes liability under the mortgage or takes the property subject to the mortgage",What is the main issue discussed in Section 4941(d)(1)(B) of the tax code?,"['The taxation of private foundations', 'The prohibition of self-dealing', 'The exception for furnishing facilities', 'The requirement for leasing property without charge']",1

Rul. 80 -132,  1980- 1 C.B. 255 (a disqualified person’s donation to a private foundation of a  life insurance policy subject to an outstanding loan made to the donor within the 10-year period ending on the date of the donation that was not insignificant in  relation to the value of the policy was an act of self -dealing) .  (8) Leasing property between a disqualified person and a private foundation is considered self -dealing except when a disqualified person leases property to a  foundation w ithout charge. A lease is considered to be without charge even  though the foundation pays for reasonable janitorial services, utilities or other maintenance costs it incurs for the use of the property, so long as the payment is not made directly or indirec tly to a disqualified person. See Treas. Reg.  53.4941(d) -2(b)(2).    (9) Certain binding leases of office space in effect on Oct. 9, 1969 (or renewals) to a foundation are excluded from self -dealing.

(2) An act of self -dealing may occur if a private foundation and a disqualified  person enter into a debtor -creditor (or  creditor -debtor) relationship, either  directly or indirectly. For example, an act of self -dealing occurs where a third - party  purchases property and assumes a mortgage, the mortgagee of which is  a private foundation, and subsequently the third party transf ers the property to a  disqualified person who either assumes liability under the mortgage or takes the property subject to the mortgage",What is the purpose of Treasury Regulation 53.4941(d)-2(b)(3)?,"['To exclude certain binding leases of office space in effect on Oct. 9, 1969 (or renewals) to a foundation from self-dealing.', 'To broadly construe the statutory language ""subject to a mortgage or similar lien"" to apply to transfers in which an individual may improperly benefit from a transaction even though there\'s no clear and immediate detriment to or relinquishment by the foundation.', 'To provide an exception for furnishing facilities under Section 4941(d)(2)(D)', 'To allow leasing property between a disqualified person and a private foundation without charge.']",0

The value of such furnishing, taken in conjunction with any other payment of compensation or payment or reimbursement of expenses to such person by the foundation, is not excessive for services such person performed in the capacity as f oundation manager or employee.   See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -2(d)(2). For example, a foundation manager  provided meals and lodging as caretaker of a historical site operated by a foundation might qualify for the exception.   B.4. Payment of Compensation (or Paymen t or Reimbursement of  Expenses) (Section 4941(d)(1)(D), 4941(d)(2)(E))   (1) A foundation’s payment of compensation or payment or reimbursement of expenses to a disqualified person is generally self-dealing. See Section  4941(d)(1)(D). However, an exception to this rule is made for the payment of  compensation by a foundation to or reimbursement of expenses of a disqualified party  (other than a government official)  for the performance of  personal services which are reasonable and necessary to carrying out the exempt purposes of the foundation, providing the payment is not excessive.  See Section 4941(d)(2)(E) and Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -3(c)(1).   (2) Payment of expenses includes reasonable advances for expenses anticipated in the immediate future by the foundation. Payment of a cash advance to a foundation manager or employee for expenses on behalf of the foundation is not an act of self -dealing so long as the amount of the advance is reasonable in  relation to duties and expense requirements. Such advances shall not ordinarily   16   exceed $500. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -3(c)(1), which sets forth the  requirements for such cash advances .   Example:  If a private foundation makes an advance to a foundation manager to  cover anticipated out -of-pocket current expenses for a reasonable period (such  as a month) and the manager accounts to the private foundation under a  periodic reimbursement program for actual expenses incurred, the private foundation will not be regarded as having engaged in an act of self -dealing:   a. When it makes the advance,   b. When it replenishes the funds upon receipt of supporting vouchers from the foundation manager, or   c. If it temporarily adds to the advance to cover extraordinary expenses  anticipated to be incurred in fulfillment of a special assignment (such as  long- distance travel).   (3) Rev. Rul. 73 -613, 1973- 2 C.B. 385 held the payment of legal fees on behalf of a  director -manager of a private foundation relating to the filing of a lawsuit arising  out of his duties as a director did not constitute an act of self -dealing by  reason  of the exception provided by Section 4941(d)(2)(E).   (4) The disqualified person providing the personal services need not be an  individual, so “personal services” refers instead to the nature of the services. The term “personal services” includes the services of a broker serving as an agent for the private foundation, but not the services of a dealer who buys from the private foundation as principal and resells to third parties. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -3(c)(1).   (5) Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -3(c)(2) provides the following four examples of payment  of compensation for certain personal services.   a. M, a partnership, is a law firm. A and B are partners of M and serve as trustees to the private foundation and therefore are disqualified persons. Also, A and B own more than 35%  of the profits interest in M, thereby  making M a disqualified person. M performs various legal services for the private foundation. The payment of compensation by the private foundation to M shall not constitute an act of self -dealing if the services performed are  reasonable and necessary for carrying out  of the private foundation’s  exempt purposes and the amount paid by the private foundation for such services is not excessive.   b. Manager of a private foundation owns an investment counseling business. Acting in his capacity as an investment counselor Manager manages  foundation’s investment portfolio for which he receives an amount which is  determined to be not excessive. The payment of such compensation to  Manager shall not constitute an act of self -dealing.   c. A commercial b ank serv es as trustee for private f oundation. In addition to  bank’s duties as trustee, b ank maintains foundation’s checking and savings   17   accounts and rents a safety deposit box to foundation",Can a private foundation pay a cash advance to a foundation manager or employee for expenses on behalf of the foundation?,"['Yes, but only if the advance is reasonable in relation to the duties and expense requirements of the manager or employee.', 'No, cash advances are not allowed for personal services.', 'Yes, but only if the manager or employee is a disqualified person.', 'No, the foundation must reimburse expenses only after they have been incurred.']",0

To reduce the cost of the bonds, a  private foundation agreed to guarantee the payment of both the principal  and the interest on the bonds. A disqualified person with respect to the  foundation, who was also an officer of the hospital, planned to purchase a  portion of the bond issue. However, the private foundation’s guarantee did not and would never apply to any bonds purchased by the disqualified person. The arrangement did not result in any use of the foundation's  assets for the economic benefit of t he disqualified person, and any benefit  derived by the disqualified person by virtue of that person's position as an   21   officer of the hospital was considered incidental or tenuous, so there was no  act of self -dealing.

A disqualified person with respect to the  foundation, who was also an officer of the hospital, planned to purchase a  portion of the bond issue. However, the private foundation’s guarantee did not and would never apply to any bonds purchased by the disqualified person. The arrangement did not result in any use of the foundation's  assets for the economic benefit of t he disqualified person, and any benefit  derived by the disqualified person by virtue of that person's position as an   21   officer of the hospital was considered incidental or tenuous, so there was no  act of self -dealing.

IRS_Document_1.pdf,"(5) Examples of incidental or tenuous  benefit :   a. A foundation’s grant to a public charity will not be an act of self -dealing  merely because the charity is located in the same area as a substantial  contributor corporation.  See Example 1 of Treas. Reg 53.4941(d) -2(f)(9).   b. A scholarship or a fellowship grant to a person other than a disqualified  person, which is paid or incurred by a private foundation in accordance with  a program which is consistent with the requirements of the foundation's  exempt status under Section 501(c)(3),  the requirements for the allowance  of deductions under Section 170 for contributions made to the foundation,  and the requirements of Section 4945(g)(1) will not be an act of self -dealing  under Section 4941(d)(1) merely because a disqualified person indirectly  receives an incidental benefit from such grant.  Thus, a scholarship or a  fellowship grant made by a private foundation in accordance with a program to award scholarships or fellowship grants to the children of employees of a substantial contributor shall not constitute an act of self -dealing if the  requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied.  See Example 2 of  Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -2(f)(9) and Rev. Rul. 80 -310, 1980- 2 C.B. 319.    20   c.

See Example 3 of  Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -2(f)(9).   d. A foundation’s naming of a recreation center after a substantial contributor is considered an incidental benefit. See  Example 4 of Treas.

Rul. 73 -407, 1973- 2 C.B. 383 ( a  contribution by a private foundation to a public charity made on the condition that the public charity change its name to that of a substantial contributor to the foundation and agree not to change the name again for 100 years does not constitute an act of self -dealing).    e. A foundation’s grant to a public charity , one of whose officers, directors or  trustees is also a manager or substantial contributor with respect to the foundation is considered an incidental benefit. See Rev. Rul. 75- 42, 1975- 1  C.B. 359, clarified by Rev.

Termination Tax   (1) This section focuses on those situations when tax is due under Section 507 for  termination of private foundation status. The termination tax acts like a third tier  excise tax. The phrase “termination” has several different meanings in the context of private foundations. T he term is ordinarily used when an entity  dissolves or goes out of business. For a private foundation, however, termination of foundation status  doesn’t necessarily mean dissolution has  occurred. Termination for Section 507 purposes means  any of the follow ing:   63   a. The foundation notifies the IRS and pays the Section 507(c) tax (if any).  (Section 507(a)(1)).     b. The IRS involuntarily terminates the foundation and imposes Section 507(c)  tax. (Section 507(a)(2)).    c. The foundation transfers all  of its net assets to certain public charities.  (Section 507(b)(1)(A)).    d. The foundation becomes a public charity. (Section 507(b)(1)( B)).  Note : Transfer under Section 507(b)(2) of all of a foundation’s net assets to one  or more other foundations does not, by itself, terminate private foundation  status.    (2) If the foundation hasn’t engaged in repeated willful acts or one flagrant, willful act triggering Chapter 42 taxes, the foundation may opt for termination under  Section 507(b) (1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) . If terminated under Section 507(b) (1), the  foundation pays $0 in termination taxes.    (3) If the foundation voluntarily terminates under Section  507(a)(1), the  foundation   submit s its final Form 990- PF and pay s a termination tax  ($0 tax if the  foundation distributes all of its net assets before providing notice of termination) .  The foundation follows the instructions to the Form 990- PF as to the method of  notification.   (4) Consider a Section 507(a)(2) involuntary termination ( resulting in Section 507(c)  tax) when there have been multiple willful repeated acts committed under  Chapter 42. Also consider Section 507(a)(2) if there has been one willful flagrant act (or failure to act) committed triggering Chapter 42 treatment. If  proposing involuntary termination, revocation may be proposed at the same time.   Note:  If a private foundation’s Section 501(c)(3) status is revoked but its private  foundation status is not terminated under Section 507, then the foundation becomes a taxable private foundation; it is no longer tax -exempt but still subject  to Chapter 42 taxes as a private foundation. See Section 509(b) and Treas. Reg. 1.509(b) -1(b).   Note:  As a practical matter, termination tax assessments are more likely to  occur during a subsequent examination.

(Section 507(b)(1)( B)).  Note : Transfer under Section 507(b)(2) of all of a foundation’s net assets to one  or more other foundations does not, by itself, terminate private foundation  status.    (2) If the foundation hasn’t engaged in repeated willful acts or one flagrant, willful act triggering Chapter 42 taxes, the foundation may opt for termination under  Section 507(b) (1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) . If terminated under Section 507(b) (1), the  foundation pays $0 in termination taxes.    (3) If the foundation voluntarily terminates under Section  507(a)(1), the  foundation   submit s its final Form 990- PF and pay s a termination tax  ($0 tax if the  foundation distributes all of its net assets before providing notice of termination) .  The foundation follows the instructions to the Form 990- PF as to the method of  notification.   (4) Consider a Section 507(a)(2) involuntary termination ( resulting in Section 507(c)  tax) when there have been multiple willful repeated acts committed under  Chapter 42. Also consider Section 507(a)(2) if there has been one willful flagrant act (or failure to act) committed triggering Chapter 42 treatment. If  proposing involuntary termination, revocation may be proposed at the same time.   Note:  If a private foundation’s Section 501(c)(3) status is revoked but its private  foundation status is not terminated under Section 507, then the foundation becomes a taxable private foundation; it is no longer tax -exempt but still subject  to Chapter 42 taxes as a private foundation. See Section 509(b) and Treas. Reg. 1.509(b) -1(b).   Note:  As a practical matter, termination tax assessments are more likely to  occur during a subsequent examination. Once Chapter 42 taxes have been assessed, any new violations identified in a later examination will provide proof  of willfulness",How does a private foundation become a public charity?,"['By transferring all of its net assets to certain public charities.

(8) Section 4961(c) suspends the period of limitations on collection of second tier  taxes if  an action for refund of the first  tier tax is commenced not later than 90  days after the day on which the second tier tax is assessed .    31   (9) Section 4963 sets out definitions of the crucial terms in the revised two- tier tax  scheme.   (10) Section 6684 imposes a penalty upon a person who becomes liable for a tax  under Section 4941 for any act not due to reasonable cause, if the person has previously been liable for tax under Chapter 42, or the act is willful and flagrant.   The penalty equals the tax imposed under Secti on 4941. See Moody v.  Commissioner , 69 T.C.M. 2517 (1995).    (11) Section 4962 provides for abatement of certain first  tier taxes, but Section  4941(a) taxes are not included.  See Section 4962(b).         32   III. Other Considerations   (1) There are other considerations that need t o be reviewed when looking at a  transaction that may fall within the definition of Section 4941.   A. Indirect Self -Dealing   (1) The various enumerated acts of self -dealing may be engaged in directly  between a disqualified party and a private foundation or indirectl y through a  third party.   (2) Neither the Code nor the R egulations comprehensively define indirect self - dealing. Section 4941(d) prohibits indirect as well as direct acts of self -dealing.  One form of indirect self -dealing is a transaction between a disqualified person  and an organization controlled by a private foundation.  The definition of control  for this purpose i s found in Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -1(b)(5) .   (3) For situations involving indirect acts of self -dealing, see Adams v.  Commissioner, 70 T.C. 373 (1978) ( the court noted that it is the use of the  assets or income of a foundation and the actual or constructive benefit derived  by the disqualified person which are the relevant considerations  in its finding of  indirect self -dealing transactions (a sale and a loan) between a disqualified  person and an organization controlled by a foundation); and Moody v. Commissioner , supra ( the court noted that failure of an organization to come  within the ""control"" tests is not determinative of a lack of indirect self -dealing  and held that portions of some of the foundation’s grants to intermediary charities not contr olled by the foundation were used for the benefit of  disqualified persons and resulted in indirect self -dealing ).   (4) Certain transactions involving third parties are excepted from the self -dealing  provisions. These exclusions are explained below . See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) - 1(b).   A.1. Control   (1) An organization is controlled by a private foundation if the foundation, its managers, or disqualified persons are able, by aggregating their voting power or positions of authority with that of the foundation, to require the organization to act or refrain from acting in a manner which would constitute self -dealing",What is the purpose of Section 6214(c) of the tax code?,"['To provide the Tax Court with jurisdiction to determine whether the taxable event has been corrected.', 'To give the IRS the authority to determine a deficiency for the second-tier tax over which the Tax Court can assume jurisdiction.', 'To suspend the period of limitations on the collection of second-tier taxes if an action for refund of the first-tier tax is commenced.', 'To impose a penalty on a person who becomes liable for a tax under Section 4941 for any act not due to reasonable cause.']",1
IRS_Document_1.pdf,"These exclusions are explained below . See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) - 1(b).   A.1. Control   (1) An organization is controlled by a private foundation if the foundation, its managers, or disqualified persons are able, by aggregating their voting power or positions of authority with that of the foundation, to require the organization to act or refrain from acting in a manner which would constitute self -dealing.   (2) An organization will be considered to be controlled by a private foundation, or by a private foundation and disqualified persons, if such persons are able, in fact, to control the organization (even if their aggregate voting power is less  than 50% of the total voting power of the organization's governing body) or if  one or more of such persons has the right to exercise veto power over the actions of such organization relevant to any potential acts of self -dealing. A  private foundation shall not be regarded as having control over an organization merely because it exercises expenditure responsibility (as defined in S ection  4945(h)) with respect to grants to such organi zation.    33   (3) A controlled organization may be any type of exempt or nonexempt  organization including a school, hospital, operating foundation or social welfare organization. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -1(b)(5).   (4) Rev. Rul. 76 -158, 1976- 1 C.B. 354, holds that a foundation does not control a  corporation for purposes of Section 4941 where the foundation owns 35% of the voting stock and its foundation manager personally owns the remaining 65% but does not hold a position of authority in the corporation by virtue of being a foundation manager.  See also Moody v. Commissioner,  supra, which h eld that  a disqualified person’s transactions with a hotel were not indirect self -dealing,  due to findings that the foundation did not control the hotel company and that the transactions did not otherwise amount to indirect self -dealing.   A.2. Certain Business Transactions  (1) Indirect self -dealing does not include any transaction described in Section  4941(d)(1) between a disqualified person and an organization controlled by a private foundation if:  a. The transaction results from a business relationship which was established prior to the effective date of Section 4941,   b. The transaction was at least as favorable to the organization controlled by the foundation as an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated person, and   c. Either the organization controlled by the foundation would have suffered severe economic hardship by engaging in the transaction with an unrelated party , or the controlled organization provided a unique product or service  unavailable  elsewhere. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(d) -1(b)(1).   A.3. Grants to Intermediaries   (1) Indirect self -dealing does not include a transaction between a government  official and an intermediary organization that received a grant from a private foundation and which is not controlled by the foundation ( Treas. Regs.  53.4941(d) -1(b)(2) and 53.4941(d) -1(b)(5)) provided that the private foundation:   a. Does not earmark the grant for a named government official, and   b. Does not exercise any control over the selection process. A member of  the  foundation cannot participate in the government official’s selection procedure. See also PLR 9421039 (1994). (PLR's are not precedential guidance.)   (2) A grant by a private foundation shall not constitute an indirect act of self -dealing  even though such foundation had reason to believe that certain government officials would derive benefits from such grant so long as the intermediary organization exercises  control over the selection process and makes the  selection completely independently of the private foundation.    A.4. Estate Administration Exclusion    34   (1) Indirect self -dealing does not include the sale to a disqualified person of  property held by an estate (or revocable trust, including a trust which has  become irrevocable on a grantor’s death) of which a private foundation is a beneficiary if:   a. The administrator, executor or trustee can sell, is required to sell, or can reallocate the property to another beneficiary,   b.

IRS_Document_1.pdf,"See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(e)(1)(i).   (2) The regulation cited above provi des numerous examples.   Example:  On August 31, 1970, private foundation sells a building to a  disqualified person. Private foundation is on the calendar year basis. Under these circumstances, the transaction between the private foundation and the disqualif ied person is one act of self -dealing, which is treated for purposes of  Section 4941 as occurring on August 31, 1970.   Example:  Assume the facts as stated above except that, instead of selling the  building to private foundation, disqualified person leases the building to the  foundation for a term of four years beginning July 31, 1970, at an annual rental of $12,000. The fair rental value of the building is also $12,000 per annum as of July 31, 1970, and throughout the next 4 years. This transaction is corrected on September 30, 1973. Under these circumstances, the transaction between the disqualified person and the private foundation constitutes four separate acts of self-dealing, which are treated for purposes of Section 4941 as occurring on  July 31, 1970, January 1, 1971, January 1, 1972, and January 1, 1973.   (3) The first tier tax for an act of self -dealing (whether discrete or continuing) is  imposed annually for each taxable year (or part thereof) during the taxable period, not only in the taxable year in which the self -dealing took place. See  Treas. Reg. 53.4941(b) -1(a)(1) and GCM 39066 (1983), as modified by GCM  39451 (1985).   (4) The 1981 CPE Statute of Limitations for Exempt Organization’s Returns, though  older and not updated, provides an example that is ill ustrative of the  subsequent acts.   Example:  A hypothetical assessment situation illustrates application of the  period of limitations to continuous acts of self -dealing. The situation involves a  loan made in 1974 by a private foundation to a disqualified person under circumstances not covered by any exception or transitional rule to Section 4941. The loan was made in 1974 and was corrected in 1975. The appropriate tax on the self -dealing act is $100. Both the foundation and the disqualified   37   person are calend ar year taxpayers. For the taxable periods involved, the  foundation timely filed all required returns and indicated ""no"" or ""not applicable""  to all questions concerning Chapter 42 transactions. The disqualified person did not file Form 4720. The only indic ation of the self -dealing event was the listing  of the loan note among the foundation's assets on Form 990- PF, without any  description of the relationship or identity of the note's maker. In this hypothetical situation, the foundation's return for 1974, which was timely filed and thus deemed filed on the due date of May 15, 1975, starts the six -year period  running for all taxes resulting from the 1974 act of self -dealing for each year or  part thereof in the taxable period. The taxes due for each year or par t year in  the taxable period, which ended when the act of self -dealing was corrected in  1975, are $100 for 1974, and $100 in 1975.   The period of limitations for the act of self -dealing that occurred on the first day  of 1975 (because the initial act was a continuing transaction) expires on May  15, 1982, six years after the foundation's return for 1975 was deemed filed. With respect to this second act, no taxes other than the initial tax of $100 are due because the act of self -dealing was corrected in 1975, thus ending the  taxable period. The total taxes due for both acts of self -dealing were $300.   (5) Rev. Rul. 2002- 43, 2002- 2 C.B. 85, shows how private foundation self -dealing  taxes are calculated in an instance of a private foundation to a disqualified person that spans more than one year and thus constitutes multiple acts of self - dealing.   (6) Also, in PLR 9530032 (1995) the private foundation made a multi -year loan to a  disqualified person, and it stated that there would be an act of self -dealing with  respect to each year there was an outstanding principal balance on the loan.   B. Amount Involved   (1) The taxes imposed by Section 4941 are on the ""amount involved"" in the act of self-dealing. In general, this is the greater of the amount of money and the fair  market value of other property  given, or the amount of money and the fair  market value of other property received.

For the taxable periods involved, the  foundation timely filed all required returns and indicated ""no"" or ""not applicable""  to all questions concerning Chapter 42 transactions. The disqualified person did not file Form 4720. The only indic ation of the self -dealing event was the listing  of the loan note among the foundation's assets on Form 990- PF, without any  description of the relationship or identity of the note's maker. In this hypothetical situation, the foundation's return for 1974, which was timely filed and thus deemed filed on the due date of May 15, 1975, starts the six -year period  running for all taxes resulting from the 1974 act of self -dealing for each year or  part thereof in the taxable period. The taxes due for each year or par t year in  the taxable period, which ended when the act of self -dealing was corrected in  1975, are $100 for 1974, and $100 in 1975.   The period of limitations for the act of self -dealing that occurred on the first day  of 1975 (because the initial act was a continuing transaction) expires on May  15, 1982, six years after the foundation's return for 1975 was deemed filed. With respect to this second act, no taxes other than the initial tax of $100 are due because the act of self -dealing was corrected in 1975, thus ending the  taxable period. The total taxes due for both acts of self -dealing were $300.   (5) Rev. Rul. 2002- 43, 2002- 2 C.B. 85, shows how private foundation self -dealing  taxes are calculated in an instance of a private foundation to a disqualified person that spans more than one year and thus constitutes multiple acts of self - dealing.   (6) Also, in PLR 9530032 (1995) the private foundation made a multi -year loan to a  disqualified person, and it stated that there would be an act of self -dealing with  respect to each year there was an outstanding principal balance on the loan.   B. Amount Involved   (1) The taxes imposed by Section 4941 are on the ""amount involved"" in the act of self-dealing. In general, this is the greater of the amount of money and the fair  market value of other property  given, or the amount of money and the fair  market value of other property received. See Section 4941(e)(2) and Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(b)(1)",Are there any exceptions to the rule that the amount involved is the greater of the amount of money and the fair market value of other property given or received?,"['Yes, there is an exception for transactions involving small amounts of money.', 'No, there are no exceptions to this rule.', 'Yes, there is an exception for transactions involving related parties.', 'Yes, there is an exception for transactions that are deemed to be in the best interest of the private foundation.']",1
IRS_Document_1.pdf,"See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(e)(1)(i).   (2) The regulation cited above provi des numerous examples.   Example:  On August 31, 1970, private foundation sells a building to a  disqualified person. Private foundation is on the calendar year basis. Under these circumstances, the transaction between the private foundation and the disqualif ied person is one act of self -dealing, which is treated for purposes of  Section 4941 as occurring on August 31, 1970.   Example:  Assume the facts as stated above except that, instead of selling the  building to private foundation, disqualified person leases the building to the  foundation for a term of four years beginning July 31, 1970, at an annual rental of $12,000. The fair rental value of the building is also $12,000 per annum as of July 31, 1970, and throughout the next 4 years. This transaction is corrected on September 30, 1973. Under these circumstances, the transaction between the disqualified person and the private foundation constitutes four separate acts of self-dealing, which are treated for purposes of Section 4941 as occurring on  July 31, 1970, January 1, 1971, January 1, 1972, and January 1, 1973.   (3) The first tier tax for an act of self -dealing (whether discrete or continuing) is  imposed annually for each taxable year (or part thereof) during the taxable period, not only in the taxable year in which the self -dealing took place. See  Treas. Reg. 53.4941(b) -1(a)(1) and GCM 39066 (1983), as modified by GCM  39451 (1985).   (4) The 1981 CPE Statute of Limitations for Exempt Organization’s Returns, though  older and not updated, provides an example that is ill ustrative of the  subsequent acts.   Example:  A hypothetical assessment situation illustrates application of the  period of limitations to continuous acts of self -dealing. The situation involves a  loan made in 1974 by a private foundation to a disqualified person under circumstances not covered by any exception or transitional rule to Section 4941. The loan was made in 1974 and was corrected in 1975. The appropriate tax on the self -dealing act is $100. Both the foundation and the disqualified   37   person are calend ar year taxpayers.

The taxes due for each year or par t year in  the taxable period, which ended when the act of self -dealing was corrected in  1975, are $100 for 1974, and $100 in 1975.   The period of limitations for the act of self -dealing that occurred on the first day  of 1975 (because the initial act was a continuing transaction) expires on May  15, 1982, six years after the foundation's return for 1975 was deemed filed.

See Section 4941(e)(2) and Treas.

See Section 4941(e)(2) and Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(b)(1).   Example:  A foundation pays a personal obligation, such as a Chapter 42 tax  liability, of a disq ualified person, the ""amount involved"" is the total amount paid  by the foundation.   (2) In the case of compensation paid for personal services (to other than government officials), the ""amount involved"" is the amount paid over the fair value of the services. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(b)(2).   (3) Regarding the use of money or other property  (including loans to a disqualified  person) , the “ amount involved”  is the greater of the amount paid for such use or  the fair market value of the use. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(b)(2). For a  continuing act of self -dealing, such as a loan or rental of property, a new  amount involved must be determined for each deemed ac t of self -dealing.   38   Special considerations apply to a deemed act of self -dealing involving a lending  of money or other extension of credit (a deemed loan):   a. The fair market interest rate for each deemed loan within the taxable period  is the fair market inte rest rate on the date the deemed loan occurs (which  may be higher or lower than the fair market rate on the date of the initial loan).    b. To determine the fair market value of the deemed loan, it is necessary to determine the amount of the deemed loan. The amount of the deemed loan includes not only the unpaid/outstanding principal but also any unpaid interest from the prior taxable year or years —there has been an extension  of credit with respect to this unpaid interest as well as the unpaid principal. The am ount of the deemed loan is multiplied by the fair market interest rate  to determine the amount involved for the deemed loan (unless the amount of interest actually paid during the taxable year is greater).    Example:  The IRS released Chief Counsel Advisory (CCA) 202243008,  wherein advice was sought , for purposes of the Section 4941(a)(1) excise  tax on a self -dealing loan, whether, interest that accrues on the loan during  years for which the Section 6501 period of limitation has closed (a ""closed year"") is in cluded in the loan balance to compute the amount involved for  the deemed acts of self -dealing that occur in years for which the period of  limitations is still open (an ""open year""). Per the facts of the CCA, a private  foundation makes a loan to a disqualif ied person which constitutes an act of  self-dealing under Section 4941(d)(1)(B). The unpaid interest is to be added  to the loan balance each year. The disqualified person did not make any payments of interest or principal. By the time the loan is addressed during  an examination, the period of limitations has expired for the initial act of self-dealing that occurred on the date the loan was made and for several of  the earliest deemed acts of self -dealing within the taxable period. The IRS  concluded that interest that accrues during closed years is included in the loan balance to compute the amount involved for the deemed acts of self - dealing in open years. Although Section 6501 generally prohibits the  assessment of amounts of tax more than three years after t he filing of a  return , the loan balance, including accrued but unpaid interest, is not an  amount of tax . Therefore, even though the IRS may not assess the Section  4941 excise tax for acts of self -dealing that occurred in closed years, any  accrued interest and principal payments from closed years affect the loan  balance going forward and must be accounted for to determine the amount  involved for deemed acts of self -dealing that occur in open years.

The excess (if any) of the amount they  received from the foundation over  the fair market value (lesser of the value at the time of the act of self -  43   dealing or at the time of correction) for the use of the property until the time  of termination,  plus   b. The excess (if any) of the fair market value of the use of the property for the period the foundation would have used the property if termination had not occurred, over the amount that would have been paid by the foundation after termination for use in such period.

(6) Sale by disqualified person to foundation. As with sales by a foundation, undoing the transaction includes, but is not limited to, rescinding the sale.  Correction can be accomplished by returning the purchase price to the foundation and transforming the transaction into a gift. The sale may also be rescinded by returning the property to the disqualified person in exchange for an amount of money equal to the greatest of the cash paid on the original sale,  the fair market value of the property at the time of the original sale, or the fair market value at the time of rescission. In addition, the disqualified person must pay to the foundation any income realized from the use of the proceeds of the sale to the extent that the income exceeds any income earned by the foundation from the use of the property.

The disqualified person must also pay over any net income realized as provided above.   (8) Use of property by a disqualified person. If a disqualified person uses the  property of a private foundation, correction includes, but is not limited to, termination of such use. In addition, the disqualified person must pay to the foundation:   a.

The excess (if any) of the amount that would have been paid by the disqualified party for the period after termination (if such termination had not occurred)  that the disqualified person would have used the property  (disregarding further extensions or renewals)  over the fair market value (at  the time of correction) of the use for such period.   Example:  Foundation loans $10,000 to a disqualified person, DP, for one  year on January 1, 2021, at 2% interest per year, which the disqualified  person repays in full on December 31, 2021. The fair market interest rate was 5.25% on January 1, 2021,  was 5.25%  but dropped 5% on  December  31, 2021. In order to correct this act of self -dealing on December 31, 2021,  DP must terminate use of the loan,  which DP has done  by repaying the  loan. In addition, DP must pay to Foundation $325, the excess of $525 (the fair market interest for one year ; $10,000 x 5.25% ) over $200 (the amount  paid to Foundation from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021; $10,000 x 2%). The fair market interest rate on the date of the loan is used in this case  because it is higher than the rate on the date of correction .   (9) In the case of a disqualified person’s continued use of money or other property  spanning multiple years, the fair market value for the use for each year is  determined separately —use the greater of fair market value at the time of the  act of self -dealing (first day of the tax year for continuing acts) or fair market  value at the time of correction.

IRS_Document_1.pdf,"45   V. Examination Techniques   (1) This section focuses on how to calculate and assert the excise tax once it’s   been determined that a self-dealing transaction has occurred. I t also contains  information relevant to examinations  of private foundations  in general .  A. Introduction   (1) Section 4941 taxes are imposed for every year or partial year within a taxable  period. The taxable period starts with the self -dealing act and ends with the  earlier of:   a. Correction,  b. Issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency, or   c. Assessment of the excise tax .  B. Discrete and Continuing Transactions   (1) Section 4941 self -dealing transactions are classified as discrete (one- time) or   continuing. A discrete transaction (such as a sale or exchange) only occurs   once, but the self -dealing tax on the discrete transaction is imposed each  year/partial year in the taxable period. A continuing transaction (such as  a loan,  a lease, or compensation for services) is an ongoing transaction across  taxable  years of the taxpayer. In such case, there is deemed a new act of self -dealing  on the first day of each taxable year within the taxable period of the initial act.  Each deemed new act of self -dealing has its own taxable period, and  self- dealing tax is imposed on each deemed new act for each whole or partial year   in its taxable period. See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(e)(1).    (2) Continuing transactions “pyramid” the tax liabilities but generally have a lesser  “amount involved” than discrete acts. The table below lists the transactions that are generally considered to be discrete or continuing, respectively.     Type of Transaction  Discrete or Continuing   Sale of property to/from a DP  Discrete   Exchange of property with a DP  Discrete   Leasing of property to/from a DP  Continuing   Lending of money to/from a DP  Continuing   Other extension of credit to/from a DP  Continuing   Furnishing of goods  Discrete    46   Furnishing of services  Discrete   Furnishing of facilities  Discrete (unless leasing of property)   Payment of compensation  Continuing   Transfer of PF asset to a DP  Discrete   Use of a PF asset by a DP  Continuing   Use of a PF assets for the benefit of a DP  Continuing   Agreement to make payment to government  official  Discrete     Note:  See Treas. Reg. 53.4941(e) -1(e)(1)(i) for the list of acts that are generally  treated as “continuing”.   B.1. Examples of Discrete and Continuing Transactions   (1) Discrete Transaction Example: A substantial contributor to a foundation buys  back a piece of artwork originally donated to the foundation. The payment is  made on December 30, 2015. The foundation and contributor are calendar year taxpayers. No correction was made, or tax assessed or notice of deficiency mailed until January 1, 2017. The contributor will owe tax on the transaction in 2015, again in 2016, and again in 2017. The table below illustrates the discrete concept  (self-dealing tax is owed for each of the three  years  in the taxable  period) :    Date 2016  2017  2018   12/30/2015  X X X    (2) Continuing Transaction Example: A substantial contributor donates a painting to  the foundation on January 17, 2015. The contributor then hangs the painting in his or her study in their home on the same day. No correction was made, or tax assessed or notice of deficiency mailed prior to  January 1, 2017. The  foundation and contributor are calendar year taxpayers. The contributor will owe tax on the use of the painting in 2015, 2016, and 2017. In addition, the contributor is deemed to have a new transaction on January 1, 2016, and again  on January 1, 2017. The table below illustrates the continuing (“pyramiding”) concept:      47   Date 2015 2016 2017  1/17/2015  X X X  1/1/2016    X X  1/1/2017      X    (3) Due to the nature of a transaction, the amount involved in a transaction is  determined differently based on the type of transaction. The general rule is that the amount involved is the greater of:   a. The fair market value of the property given, or   b. The fair market value of the property received.  (4) This rule is modified for the period for which money or property  is used , where  the amount involved is the greater of:   a. The amounts  paid for such use, or   b. The fair market value of such use.  (5) Other modifications may also apply. See Amount Involved, Treas. Reg.  53.4941(e) -1(b).
