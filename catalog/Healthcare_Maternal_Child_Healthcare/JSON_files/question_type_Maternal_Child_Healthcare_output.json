Unsafe abortion can be caused by demographic risk factors such as young age, high parity, and lack of access to contraception and reproductive health information. In many developing countries, young boys and girls have less access to relevant information about reproductive health, and less or no access to contraception, leading to high rates of unsafe abortion. The legal status of abortion also impacts access to safe abortion care, with 25% of the world population living in countries where induced abortion is prohibited except to save the life of the pregnant woman or without explicit exception. In contrast, 40% of the world population lives in countries where induced abortion is permitted on request of the woman, with many countries having gestational age limits. Elective abortion care has significant differences among countries, with some countries considering socio-medical factors or adverse social conditions as indicators for induced abortion.

In contrast, hormonal methods like the pill have a higher risk of side effects such as blood clots and stroke. The benefits and risks of each method must be carefully weighed, and counseling by family planning providers can help reduce the risks. Family planning programs should provide a range of methods to meet varying family planning needs throughout the life cycle and for both women and men, and access to services should be available in both public and private health facilities and through community-based distribution networks.
