Additionally, a compliance management program provides a basis for Customs to assess its own performance in revenue protection and enforcement of laws, improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and develop strategies to improve compliance. One approach to compliance measurement is to focus on the top 5-10% of highest volume manufacturers, importers, exporters, and commodities, and measure compliance in areas such as documentary issues, procedural issues, revenue issues, transport issues, and specific concerns. Customs can also gather data from various sources, both internal and external, and use automated and manual means to arrive at reasonable, informed conclusions about compliance rates. They can determine an acceptable level of compliance, use a statistically valid sampling methodology to select specific transactions or entities for review or verification, and modify the universe of transactions based on the results. Finally, they can use a variety of transaction processes for compliance verifications, such as goods declaration compliance, trader compliance, transit compliance, free trade zone or warehouse compliance, manifest and transport document compliance, and transporter compliance."
