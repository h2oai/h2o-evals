                        "To renew an expired ITIN, you can find more information at IRS.gov/ITIN. If you are not eligible for an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it wherever your SSN is requested on your tax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax return at least once for tax years 2020, 2021, or 2022, it has expired and must be renewed if you need to file a federal tax return. You don't need to renew your ITIN if you don't need to file a federal tax return. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again unless you haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax return at least once for tax years 2020, 2021, or 2022. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS office or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and want all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it are at IRS.gov/ITIN. Nonresident Alien Spouse If your spouse is a nonresident alien, your spouse must have either an SSN or an ITIN if: \u2022You file a joint return, or \u2022Your spouse is filing a separate return. Presidential Election Campaign Fund This fund helps pay for Presidential election campaigns. The fund reduces candidates' dependence on large contributions from individuals and groups and places candidates on an equal financial footing in the general election.
