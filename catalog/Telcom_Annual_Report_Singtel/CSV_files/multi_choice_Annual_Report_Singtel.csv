Our three corporate academies - Singtel 8George  and NCS Dojo in Singapore, and Optus U in Australia offer  employee training under four pillars of Personal Excellence, 5G/ Tech Acceleration, Leadership Excellence and Future-Readiness.  In Singapore, we have committed to investing S$20 million  annually in our people development programmes.  During the year, we launched work-study programmes called  Catalyst and Fusion at Singtel and NCS respectively, allowing  diploma graduates to work full-time in ICT while pursuing a  degree. NCS also offers NUCLEUS, a five-year programme that  equips talents with professional training, technical expertise  and industry experience in their chosen field of specialisation.  We introduced a five-module e-learning course on the  fundamentals of sustainability for our people in Singapore to  raise more awareness and deeper understanding of the subject.   We believe this is key to arming them with perspectives they  need to advance sustainability on corporate and personal fronts. In addition, we held a full-day sustainability workshop for our  top executives and piloted a workshop on inclusive leadership,  as well as an interactive learning on workplace diversity and  inclusion for over 100 top executives, which will be offered to  all people leaders. In Australia, we continued to expand Optus U with new  streams of learning within data and analytics, automation,  commercial acumen, cyber security, product management  and sustainability, and tripled our Tech Talent Graduate intake  with 50 new students across various tech specialities. Supporting our communities 2022 marked the 20th anniversary of the Singtel Touching Lives  Fund, our corporate philanthropy programme, which has raised  more than S$54 million to date. We marked this milestone with Expressions Through Art,  Singapore’s first art exhibition to feature artworks from all local  special education schools. The year also marked the return of our  popular Singtel Carnival, Singapore’s biggest event dedicated to  children with special needs. Our event saw 2,000 students – our  biggest turnout yet – enjoying a day playing games and activities  organised by 1,900 staff volunteers.  It was also a milestone year as we celebrated ten years of helping  children and youth stay safe online with our Optus Digital  Thumbprint Programme, which continues to gain momentum.  Launched in 2013, our programme has helped equip more than  half a million students in Australia with knowledge in cyber  security, digital discernment and other topics so they can better  navigate the dangers of the internet.Strengthening governance and driving  sustainable value creation Our commitment to responsible and ethical business practices  while providing quality services and solutions forms the bedrock  of how we operate our business, guided by our six core values. We  also adopt a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption of  any form, and discrimination and human rights violations across  our value chain. During the year, we conducted a Group-wide salient human  rights issues assessment and identified six potential critical  areas each for Singtel and Optus, including online safety and  supply chain, where both positive and negative human rights  impacts can occur",What is the name of the exhibition held by Singtel to feature artworks from all local special education schools in Singapore?,"['""Expressions Through Art"" (Correct)', '""Singtel Carnival""', '""Optus Digital Thumbprint Programme""', '""TCFD Reporting Framework""']",0,Annual_Report_Singtel.pdf

The decrease for both category 1 and 2 are due  to the following reasons: 1) Singtel switched from using the spend value of purchased orders (PO) to that of   goods received notes (GRN) to determine the spend amount. This improves the  data accuracy of the goods and services we purchased for the year because   GRN is only issued when the goods and services have been received by Singtel.  2) There was an update to the industry average emission factors used this year  which are more robust and reflective of the actual situation. This takes into  account adjustment for inflation, currency conversion and updates from the  source of emission factors.  3) The Group adopted a hybrid accounting method, using a mix of industry average  emission factors, company emission factors and product carbon footprint.

"(b) Energy efficiency improvement through optimisation   and upgrades   We are continuously improving our energy efficiency to reduce  our electricity consumption. During the year, we upgraded  three chillers at our exchange in Novena, saving an average of  516.84MWh annually. This wraps up our entire chiller upgrade  project which we started in 2018, involving a total of 33 chillers  with annual savings of 7,920MWh. For our new 5G network, we have enabled its sleep function  which allows the 3.5GHz capacity layer or wavelength to be  turned off during our maintenance period every night. This  is expected to save 860.19MWh annually. We will continue to  look at ways to maximise 5G’s energy efficiency. Our network  management also embraces advanced technologies and big  data analytics. For instance, we improved the design of existing  4G Radio Access Network (RAN) during the year, leveraging  artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to predict  traffic patterns of individual radio cell transmitters. This resulted  in optimised cell sleep configurations and energy savings of up  to 8% annually or an average of 1,651MWh annual savings.  We have upgraded the technology in many of our facilities to  be more energy efficient. NCS Hub, which started retrofitting  works in April 2017, has replaced lights in all stairwells,  washrooms, offices and carpark with light emitting diode (LED)  ones, saving a total of 557.30MWh to date. All passenger lifts  have been replaced with more energy efficient alternating  current variable voltages and variable frequency (VVVF) motor  drives, contributing to an annual saving of 37.23MWh. The  retrofit is expected to be completed in 2025 and NCS Hub is  expected to save a total of 956.87MWh annually.   We have also replaced the lights in other facilities, resulting  in more than 235.90MWh annual savings.

"(b) Energy efficiency improvement through optimisation   and upgrades   We are continuously improving our energy efficiency to reduce  our electricity consumption. During the year, we upgraded  three chillers at our exchange in Novena, saving an average of  516.84MWh annually. This wraps up our entire chiller upgrade  project which we started in 2018, involving a total of 33 chillers  with annual savings of 7,920MWh. For our new 5G network, we have enabled its sleep function  which allows the 3.5GHz capacity layer or wavelength to be  turned off during our maintenance period every night. This  is expected to save 860.19MWh annually. We will continue to  look at ways to maximise 5G’s energy efficiency. Our network  management also embraces advanced technologies and big  data analytics. For instance, we improved the design of existing  4G Radio Access Network (RAN) during the year, leveraging  artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to predict  traffic patterns of individual radio cell transmitters. This resulted  in optimised cell sleep configurations and energy savings of up  to 8% annually or an average of 1,651MWh annual savings.  We have upgraded the technology in many of our facilities to  be more energy efficient. NCS Hub, which started retrofitting  works in April 2017, has replaced lights in all stairwells,  washrooms, offices and carpark with light emitting diode (LED)  ones, saving a total of 557.30MWh to date. All passenger lifts  have been replaced with more energy efficient alternating  current variable voltages and variable frequency (VVVF) motor  drives, contributing to an annual saving of 37.23MWh. The  retrofit is expected to be completed in 2025 and NCS Hub is  expected to save a total of 956.87MWh annually.   We have also replaced the lights in other facilities, resulting  in more than 235.90MWh annual savings. For example, flood  lights at our teleports are progressively being replaced with  LED bulbs that use at least 75% less energy than fluorescent  bulbs.

NCS Hub, which started retrofitting  works in April 2017, has replaced lights in all stairwells,  washrooms, offices and carpark with light emitting diode (LED)  ones, saving a total of 557.30MWh to date. All passenger lifts  have been replaced with more energy efficient alternating  current variable voltages and variable frequency (VVVF) motor  drives, contributing to an annual saving of 37.23MWh. The  retrofit is expected to be completed in 2025 and NCS Hub is  expected to save a total of 956.87MWh annually.   We have also replaced the lights in other facilities, resulting  in more than 235.90MWh annual savings. For example, flood  lights at our teleports are progressively being replaced with  LED bulbs that use at least 75% less energy than fluorescent  bulbs. We have rolled out LED lighting across our retail stores  and have completed lighting upgrades at 98% of our network  sites across Australia. (c) Renewable transition  The networks, offices and other facilities we operate to support  our connectivity operations consume electricity. Investment in  onsite renewable energy generation and backing our electricity  consumption with local renewable energy sources will aid in our  decarbonisation journey. We also aim to increase the amount  of our electricity consumption backed by renewable energy  sources, which will help reduce our scope 2 emissions. Our fleet of electric vehicles in Singapore.
