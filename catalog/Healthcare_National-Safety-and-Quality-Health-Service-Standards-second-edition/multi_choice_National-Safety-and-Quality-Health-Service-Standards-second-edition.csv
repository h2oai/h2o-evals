The primary aims of the NSQHS Standards  are to protect the public from harm and to improve  the quality of health service provision. They provide  a quality assurance mechanism that tests whether  relevant systems are in place to ensure that expected  standards of safety and quality are met. There are eight NSQHS Standards, which cover  high-prevalence adverse events, healthcare- associated infections, medication safety,  comprehensive care, clinical communication, the  prevention and management of pressure injuries,  the prevention of falls, and responding to clinical  deterioration. Importantly, these NSQHS Standards  have provided a nationally consistent statement  about the standard of care consumers can expect  from their health service organisations.

National-Safety-and-Quality-Health-Service-Standards-second-edition.pdf,"Importantly, these NSQHS Standards  have provided a nationally consistent statement  about the standard of care consumers can expect  from their health service organisations.  The eight NSQHS Standards are:  Clinical Governance , which describes the  clinical governance, and safety and quality  systems that are required to maintain and  improve the reliability, safety and quality of  health care, and improve health outcomes  for patients.  Partnering with Consumers , which  describes the systems and strategies to  create a person-centred health system by  including patients in shared decision  making, to ensure that patients are partners  in their own care, and that consumers are  involved in the development and design of  quality health care.   Preventing and Controlling Healthcare- Associated Infection , which describes the  systems and strategies to prevent infection,  to manage infections effectively when they  occur, and to limit the development of  antimicrobial resistance through prudent  use of antimicrobials, as part of effective  antimicrobial stewardship. Medication Safety , which describes the  systems and strategies to ensure that  clinicians safely prescribe, dispense and  administer appropriate medicines to  informed patients, and monitor use of the  medicines.  Comprehensive Care , which describes the  integrated screening, assessment and risk  identification processes for developing an  individualised care plan, to prevent and  minimise the risks of harm in identified  areas.  Communicating for Safety , which  describes the systems and strategies for  effective communication between patients,  carers and families, multidisciplinary teams  and clinicians, and across the health service  organisation.  Blood Management , which describes the  systems and strategies for the safe,  appropriate, efficient and effective care of  patients’ own blood, as well as other  supplies of blood and blood products.  Recognising and Responding to Acute  Deterioration , which describes the systems  and processes to respond effectively to  patients when their physical, mental or  cognitive condition deteriorates.  Each standard contains: • A description of the standard • A statement of intent • A list of criteria that describe the key areas  covered by the standard • Explanatory notes on the content of the standard • Item headings for groups of actions in each  criterion • Actions that describe what is required to meet  the standard. 2  NSQHS Standards The NSQHS Standards require the  implementation of organisation-wide systems  for clinical governance, partnering with  consumers, healthcare-associated infections,  medication safety, comprehensive care, effective  communication, blood management, and  recognising and responding to acute deterioration. The Clinical Governance Standard and the  Partnering with Consumers Standard set the  overarching system requirements for the effective  implementation of the remaining six standards,  which consider specific high-risk clinical areas  of patient care. The NSQHS Standards describe  the patient care journey and are designed to  be implemented in an integrated way. Similar  implementation strategies apply to multiple actions  across the NSQHS Standards. It is important to  identify the links between actions across each of  the eight NSQHS Standards. This will help health  service organisations to ensure that their safety  and quality systems are integrated, and reduce the  duplication of effort in implementing the eight  standards separately. Important improvements in the safety and quality  of patient care have been documented following  implementation of the first edition of the NSQHS  Standards from 2011, including: • A decline in the Staphylococcus aureus   bacteraemia rate per 10,000 patient days under  surveillance between 2010 and 2014, from 1.1 to  0.87 cases • A drop in the yearly number of methicillin-   resistant S. aureus  bacteraemia cases between  2010 and 2014, from 505 to 389 • A decline of almost one-half in the national rate  of central line-associated bloodstream infections  between 2012–13 and 2013–14, from 1.02 to 0.6  per 1,000 line days",What is the purpose of the NSQHS Standards?,"['To provide a nationally consistent statement about the standard of care consumers can expect from their health service organizations.', 'To describe the clinical governance and safety and quality systems that are required to maintain and improve the reliability, safety, and quality of healthcare.', 'To prevent and control healthcare-associated infections and minimize the risks of harm in identified areas.', 'To ensure that clinicians safely prescribe, dispense, and administer appropriate medicines to informed patients.']",1
National-Safety-and-Quality-Health-Service-Standards-second-edition.pdf,"Importantly, these NSQHS Standards  have provided a nationally consistent statement  about the standard of care consumers can expect  from their health service organisations.  The eight NSQHS Standards are:  Clinical Governance , which describes the  clinical governance, and safety and quality  systems that are required to maintain and  improve the reliability, safety and quality of  health care, and improve health outcomes  for patients.  Partnering with Consumers , which  describes the systems and strategies to  create a person-centred health system by  including patients in shared decision  making, to ensure that patients are partners  in their own care, and that consumers are  involved in the development and design of  quality health care.   Preventing and Controlling Healthcare- Associated Infection , which describes the  systems and strategies to prevent infection,  to manage infections effectively when they  occur, and to limit the development of  antimicrobial resistance through prudent  use of antimicrobials, as part of effective  antimicrobial stewardship. Medication Safety , which describes the  systems and strategies to ensure that  clinicians safely prescribe, dispense and  administer appropriate medicines to  informed patients, and monitor use of the  medicines.  Comprehensive Care , which describes the  integrated screening, assessment and risk  identification processes for developing an  individualised care plan, to prevent and  minimise the risks of harm in identified  areas.  Communicating for Safety , which  describes the systems and strategies for  effective communication between patients,  carers and families, multidisciplinary teams  and clinicians, and across the health service  organisation.  Blood Management , which describes the  systems and strategies for the safe,  appropriate, efficient and effective care of  patients’ own blood, as well as other  supplies of blood and blood products.  Recognising and Responding to Acute  Deterioration , which describes the systems  and processes to respond effectively to  patients when their physical, mental or  cognitive condition deteriorates.  Each standard contains: • A description of the standard • A statement of intent • A list of criteria that describe the key areas  covered by the standard • Explanatory notes on the content of the standard • Item headings for groups of actions in each  criterion • Actions that describe what is required to meet  the standard. 2  NSQHS Standards The NSQHS Standards require the  implementation of organisation-wide systems  for clinical governance, partnering with  consumers, healthcare-associated infections,  medication safety, comprehensive care, effective  communication, blood management, and  recognising and responding to acute deterioration. The Clinical Governance Standard and the  Partnering with Consumers Standard set the  overarching system requirements for the effective  implementation of the remaining six standards,  which consider specific high-risk clinical areas  of patient care. The NSQHS Standards describe  the patient care journey and are designed to  be implemented in an integrated way.

They  undergo invasive procedures, have medical devices  inserted, and receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and  immunosuppression therapies. These conditions  create ideal opportunities for the adaptation and  spread of pathogenic infectious agents. Each year, many infections are associated with the  provision of health care and affect a large number  of patients.17 Healthcare-associated infections are  one of the most common complications affecting  patients. Some of these infections require stronger  and more expensive medicines (with increased  risk of complications), and may result in lifelong  disability or death. Such infections: • Cause considerable harm • Increase patient use of health services – for  example, extended length of stay, and increased  use of health resources such as inpatient beds,  treatment options and investigations • Place greater demands on the clinical workforce. Infectious microorganisms evolve over time, and  continue to present new challenges for infection  prevention and control. Currently, the main  concerns are the emergence and transmission of  antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as carbapenemase- producing Enterobacteriaceae, transmission of  existing organisms such as multidrug-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  and vancomycin-resistant  Enterococcus , and the increase in Clostridium  difficile  infections being identified in health  service organisations.Infection prevention and control aims to reduce the  development of resistant organisms and minimise  the risk of transmission through the isolation of  the infectious agent or the patient. This is done, in  part, by applying standard and transmission-based  precautions as safe work practices in the healthcare  setting. However, just as there is no single cause  of infection, there is no single solution to the  problems posed by healthcare-associated infections.

Although appropriate use of medicines  contributes to significant improvements in health,  medicines can also be associated with harm.21  Because they are so commonly used, medicines are  associated with a higher incidence of errors and  adverse events than other healthcare interventions.  Some of these adverse events are costly, and up to  50% are potentially avoidable.22 The proportion of medicine-related hospital  admissions has been estimated at approximately  2–3%.23 This proportion remains consistent,  and, based on 2011–12 Australian hospital data  of 9.3 million separations, suggests a medicine- related hospital admission rate of 230,000 annually.  Some subpopulations have higher estimates – for  example, 12% of medical admissions and 20–30%  of admissions for those aged 65 years and over.21  Studies have also revealed an average of three  medicine-related problems per resident in aged care  facilities24, and 40–50% of residents being prescribed  potentially inappropriate medicines.25,26 In general practice, 8.5–12% of patients are reported  to have experienced an adverse medicine event  within the previous six months27-29, consistent  with previous estimates of 10% of patients.30Errors affect both health outcomes for consumers  and healthcare costs. The cost of such adverse  events to individual patients and the healthcare  system is significant. A study published in  2009 reported that medication-related hospital  admissions in Australia were estimated to cost  $660 million.21 Estimates, with an average cost per  separation of $5,204 in 2011–12, place this figure  closer to $1.2 billion.21 The effects on patients’  quality of life are more difficult to quantify.

Although appropriate use of medicines  contributes to significant improvements in health,  medicines can also be associated with harm.21  Because they are so commonly used, medicines are  associated with a higher incidence of errors and  adverse events than other healthcare interventions.  Some of these adverse events are costly, and up to  50% are potentially avoidable.22 The proportion of medicine-related hospital  admissions has been estimated at approximately  2–3%.23 This proportion remains consistent,  and, based on 2011–12 Australian hospital data  of 9.3 million separations, suggests a medicine- related hospital admission rate of 230,000 annually.  Some subpopulations have higher estimates – for  example, 12% of medical admissions and 20–30%  of admissions for those aged 65 years and over.21  Studies have also revealed an average of three  medicine-related problems per resident in aged care  facilities24, and 40–50% of residents being prescribed  potentially inappropriate medicines.25,26 In general practice, 8.5–12% of patients are reported  to have experienced an adverse medicine event  within the previous six months27-29, consistent  with previous estimates of 10% of patients.30Errors affect both health outcomes for consumers  and healthcare costs. The cost of such adverse  events to individual patients and the healthcare  system is significant. A study published in  2009 reported that medication-related hospital  admissions in Australia were estimated to cost  $660 million.21 Estimates, with an average cost per  separation of $5,204 in 2011–12, place this figure  closer to $1.2 billion.21 The effects on patients’  quality of life are more difficult to quantify. Standardising and systemising processes can  improve medication safety by preventing medication  incidents. Other recognised solutions for reducing  common causes of medication incidents include: • Improving governance and quality measures  relating to medication safety • Improving clinician–workforce communication  and clinical handover • Improving clinician–patient communication and  partnership • Using technology to support information  recording and transfer • Providing better access to patient information  and clinical decision support.Medication Safety Standard  • NSQHS Standards 32 Clinical governance and quality improvement to support  medication management Organisation-wide systems are used to support and promote safety for procuring, supplying, storing,  compounding, manufacturing, prescribing, dispensing, administering and monitoring the effects of medicines.

Pressure injuries Pressure injuries can occur to patients of any  age who have one or more of the following risk  factors: immobility, older age, lack of sensory  perception, poor nutrition or hydration, excess  moisture or dryness, poor skin integrity, reduced  blood flow, limited alertness or muscle spasms.  Evidence-based strategies to prevent pressure  injuries exist and should be applied if screening  identifies that a patient is at risk. Falls Falls also occur in all age groups.

Unpredictable behaviours People in healthcare settings can exhibit  unpredictable behaviours that may lead to harm.  Health service organisations need systems to  identify situations where there is higher risk  of harm, and strategies to mitigate or prevent  these risks. They also need systems to manage  situations in which harm relating to unpredictable  behaviour occurs. For the purpose of this standard,  unpredictable behaviours include self-harm, suicide,  aggression and violence. It is important that systems  designed to respond to the risks of unpredictable  behaviour minimise further trauma to patients and  others. This relates to both the material practices  and the attitude with which care is delivered. Processes to manage people who have thoughts  of harming themselves, with or without suicidal  intent, or who have actually harmed themselves are  needed.

The health  service organisation is responsible for ensuring that  follow-up services are arranged before the person  leaves the health service, because of the known risks  of self-harm after discharge.43Some people are at higher risk of aggressive  behaviour as a result of impaired coping skills  relating to intoxication, acute physical deterioration  or mental illness.
