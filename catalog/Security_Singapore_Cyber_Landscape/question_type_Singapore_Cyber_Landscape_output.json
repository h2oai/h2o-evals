The involvement of non-state actors, such as hacktivists and Big Tech companies, has shaped the conflict and created new challenges for cybersecurity professionals. The increasing prevalence of ransomware attacks, and the willingness of some organisations to pay ransoms, has created a lucrative market for cybercriminals. This has led to a rise in the number of ransomware attacks, with potentially up to 543% more attacks going unreported. The success of these attacks has also led to the development of new forms of ransomware, such as the Hive ransomware group, which has targeted healthcare and education institutions. The impact of these attacks has been significant, with the Royal Mail in the UK being a notable example. The disruption caused by the ransomware attack on the Royal Mail highlights the real-world consequences of cyber incidents and the need for effective cybersecurity measures to mitigate these threats. The rise of non-state actors in the cyber conflict has also led to a shift in the way cybersecurity is addressed, with a greater emphasis on international cooperation and the development of global standards for cybersecurity. The establishment of the International Counter-Ransomware Task Force, coordinated by Australia, is an example of this shift. Overall, the rise of non-state actors in the cyber conflict has created new challenges for cybersecurity professionals and highlighted the need for a coordinated global response to mitigate the threats posed by ransomware attacks."

In fact, nearly 60% of organisations that paid the ransom were unable to recover all their systems and data, and nearly 80% were hit by a second ransomware attack, often demanding a higher ransom. The school district's decision not to give in to the attackers' demands may have been influenced by these statistics and the understanding that paying up does not necessarily solve the problem. It also highlights the importance of having robust cybersecurity measures in place to prevent such attacks and minimise their impact. The decision not to pay the ransom may have been influenced by the fact that many organisations that paid the ransom were hit by a second ransomware attack, often demanding a higher ransom. The school district may have decided that paying the ransom was not worth the risk of being hit by another attack and potentially losing more data. The decision not to pay the ransom may have been influenced by the fact that the attackers released a 51-minute-long video showcasing sensitive data stolen from the school district, which may have been seen as a form of retaliation for not paying the ransom. The school district may have decided that paying the ransom was not worth the risk of further retaliation and potential damage to their reputation. The decision not to pay the ransom may have been influenced by the fact that the school district had cyber insurance, which may have covered the cost of the attack and helped them to recover from it. The school district may have decided that paying the ransom was not worth the cost, especially if they had insurance to cover the expenses.
