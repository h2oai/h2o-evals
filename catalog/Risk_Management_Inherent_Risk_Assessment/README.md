# Sample Questions

#### Sample Multi choice questions from the dataset:

#### Sample Conditional questions from the dataset:

**Question:** How may the risk factors and associated requirements under VAR-002-2b R1, R2, R3, R4 remain in scope if the CEA determined that the entity’s characteristics meet higher ranked criteria?

**Answer:** The risk factors and associated requirements under VAR-002-2b R1, R2, R3, R4 would remain in scope if the CEA determined that the entity’s characteristics meet higher ranked criteria.

#### Sample Token presence from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the purpose of the Inherent Risk Assessment (IRA) Guide?

**Answer:** The purpose of the IRA Guide is to describe the process used by Compliance Enforcement Authorities (CEAs) to assess the inherent risk of registered entities and to serve as a common approach for NERC and the eight Regional Entities for implementing and performing an IRA.

**Token Presence:** ['IRA', 'Guide', 'process', 'assess', 'risk', 'entities']
